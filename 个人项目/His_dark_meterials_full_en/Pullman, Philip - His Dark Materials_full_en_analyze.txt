并列句	The first volume is set in a universe like ours, but different in many ways.
陈述句	The second volume is set partly in the universe we know.
陈述句	The third volume will move between the universes.
并列句	PART   ONE  OXFORD          0NE   THE DECANTER OF TOKAY     Lyra and her daemon moved through the darkening hall, taking care to keep to one side, out of sight of the kitchen.
并列句	The three great tables that ran the length of the hall were laid already, the silver and the glass catching what little light there was, and the long benches were pulled out ready for the guests.
陈述句	Portraits of former Masters hung high up in the gloom along the walls.
并列句	Lyra reached the dais and looked back at the open kitchen door, and, seeing no one, stepped up beside the high table.
并列句	The places here were laid with gold, not silver, and the fourteen seats were not oak benches but mahogany chairs with velvet cushions.
并列句	Lyra stopped beside the Master's chair and flicked the biggest glass gently with a fingernail.
陈述句	The sound rang clearly through the hall.
陈述句	You're not taking this seriously, whispered her daemon.
陈述句	Behave yourself.
并列句	Her daemon's name was Pantalaimon, and he was currently in the form of a moth, a dark brown one so as not to show up in the darkness of the hall.
陈述句	They're making too much noise to hear from the kitchen, Lyra whispered back.
并列句	And the Steward doesn't come in till the first bell.
陈述句	Stop fussing.
并列句	But she put her palm over the ringing crystal anyway, and Pantalaimon fluttered ahead and through the slightly open door of the Retiring Room at the other end of the dais.
陈述句	After a moment he appeared again.
陈述句	There's no one there, he whispered.
并列句	But we must be quick.
并列句	Crouching behind the high table, Lyra darted along and through the door into the Retiring Room, where she stood up and looked around.
陈述句	The only light in here came from the fireplace, where a bright blaze of logs settled slightly as she looked, sending a fountain of sparks up into the chimney.
并列句	She had lived most of her life in the College, but had never seen the Retiring Room before: only Scholars and their guests were allowed in here, and never females.
陈述句	Even the maidservants didn't clean in here.
陈述句	That was the Butler's job alone.
陈述句	Pantalaimon settled on her shoulder.
疑问句	Happy now?
疑问句	Can we go?
陈述句	he whispered.
感叹句	Don't be silly!
感叹句	I want to look around!
并列句	It was a large room, with an oval table of polished rosewood on which stood various decanters and glasses, and a silver smoking stand with a rack of pipes.
并列句	On a sideboard nearby there was a little chafing dish and a basket of poppy heads.
疑问句	They do themselves well, don't they, Pan?
陈述句	she said under her breath.
陈述句	She sat in one of the green leather armchairs.
并列句	It was so deep she found herself nearly lying down, but she sat up again and tucked her legs under her to look at the portraits on the walls.
并列句	More old Scholars, probably; robed, bearded, and gloomy, they stared out of their frames in solemn disapproval.
疑问句	What d'you think they talk about?
原因状语从句	Lyra said, or began to say, because before she'd finished the question she heard voices outside the door.
感叹句	Behind the chair-quick!
并列句	whispered Pantalaimon, and in a flash Lyra was out of the armchair and crouching behind it.
并列句	It wasn't the best one for hiding behind: she'd chosen one in the very center of the room, and unless she kept very quiet...
并列句	The door opened, and the light changed in the room; one of the incomers was carrying a lamp, which he put down on the sideboard.
并列句	Lyra could see his legs, in their dark green trousers and shiny black shoes.
陈述句	It was a servant.
疑问句	Then a deep voice said, Has Lord Asriel arrived yet?
陈述句	It was the Master.
并列句	As Lyra held her breath, she saw the servant's daemon (a dog, like all servants' daemons) trot in and sit quietly at his feet, and then the Master's feet became visible too, in the shabby black shoes he always wore.
陈述句	No, Master, said the Butler.
陈述句	No word from the aerodock, either.
陈述句	I expect he'll be hungry when he arrives.
疑问句	Show him straight into Hall, will you?
陈述句	Very good, Master.
并列句	And you've decanted some of the special Tokay for him?
陈述句	Yes, Master.
陈述句	The 1898, as you ordered.
陈述句	His Lordship is very partial to that, I remember.
陈述句	Good.
陈述句	Now leave me, please.
疑问句	Do you need the lamp, Master?
陈述句	Yes, leave that too.
疑问句	Look in during dinner to trim it, will you?
并列句	The Butler bowed slightly and turned to leave, his daemon trotting obediently after him.
并列句	From her not-much-of-a-hiding place Lyra watched as the Master went to a large oak wardrobe in the corner of the room, took his gown from a hanger, and pulled it laboriously on.
并列句	The Master had been a powerful man, but he was well over seventy now, and his movements were stiff and slow.
并列句	The Master's daemon had the form of a raven, and as soon as his robe was on, she jumped down from the wardrobe and settled in her accustomed place on his right shoulder.
让步状语从句	Lyra could feel Pantalaimon bristling with anxiety, though he made no sound.
陈述句	For herself, she was pleasantly excited.
并列句	The visitor mentioned by the Master, Lord Asriel, was her uncle, a man whom she admired and feared greatly.
并列句	He was said to be involved in high politics, in secret exploration, in distant warfare, and she never knew when he was going to appear.
并列句	He was fierce: if he caught her in here she'd be severely punished, but she could put up with that.
陈述句	What she saw next, however, changed things completely.
并列句	The Master took from his pocket a folded paper and laid it on the table beside the wine.
并列句	He took the stopper out of the mouth of a decanter containing a rich golden wine, unfolded the paper, and poured a thin stream of white powder into the decanter before crumpling the paper and throwing it into the fire.
并列句	Then he took a pencil from his pocket, stirred the wine until the powder had dissolved, and replaced the stopper.
陈述句	His daemon gave a soft brief squawk.
并列句	The Master replied in an undertone, and looked around with his hooded, clouded eyes before leaving through the door he'd come in by.
疑问句	Lyra whispered, Did you see that, Pan?
感叹句	Of course I did!
感叹句	Now hurry out, before the Steward comes!
并列句	But as he spoke, there came the sound of a bell ringing once from the far end of the hall.
感叹句	That's the Steward's bell!
陈述句	said Lyra.
陈述句	I thought we had more time than that.
并列句	Pantalaimon fluttered swiftly to the hall door, and swiftly back.
陈述句	The Steward's there already, he said.
并列句	And you can't get out of the other door...
并列句	The other door, the one the Master had entered and left by, opened onto the busy corridor between the library and the Scholars' common room.
并列句	At this time of day it was thronged with men pulling on their gowns for dinner, or hurrying to leave papers or briefcases in the common room before moving nto the hall.
陈述句	Lyra had planned to leave the way she'd come, banking on another few minutes before the Steward's bell rang.
并列句	And if she hadn't seen the Master tipping that powder into the wine, she might have risked the Steward's anger, or hoped to avoid being noticed in the busy corridor.
并列句	But she was confused, and that made her hesitate.
陈述句	Then she heard heavy footsteps on the dais.
并列句	The Steward was coming to make sure the Retiring Room was ready for the Scholars' poppy and wine after dinner.
并列句	Lyra darted to the oak wardrobe, opened it, and hid inside, pulling the door shut just as the Steward entered.
并列句	She had no fear for Pantalaimon: the room was somber colored, and he could always creep under a chair.
并列句	She heard the Steward's heavy wheezing, and through the crack where the door hadn't quite shut she saw him adjust the pipes in the rack by the smoking stand and cast a glance over the decanters and glasses.
并列句	Then he smoothed the hair over his ears with both palms and said something to his daemon.
并列句	He was a servant, so she was a dog; but a superior servant, so a superior dog.
陈述句	In fact, she had the form of a red setter.
并列句	The daemon seemed suspicious, and cast around as if she'd sensed an intruder, but didn't make for the wardrobe, to Lyra's intense relief.
陈述句	Lyra was afraid of the Steward, who had twice beaten her.
陈述句	Lyra heard a tiny whisper; obviously Pantalaimon had squeezed in beside her.
陈述句	We're going to have to stay here now.
疑问句	Why don't you listen to me?
陈述句	She didn't reply until the Steward had left.
陈述句	It was his job to supervise the waiting at the high table; she could hear the Scholars coming into the hall, the murmur of voices, the shuffle of feet.
陈述句	It's a good thing I didn't, she whispered back.
陈述句	We wouldn't have seen the Master put poison in the wine otherwise.
感叹句	Pan, that was the Tokay he asked the Butler about!
感叹句	They're going to kill Lord Asriel!
陈述句	You don't know it's poison.
陈述句	Oh, of course it is.
疑问句	Don't you remember, he made the Butler leave the room before he did it?
条件状语从句	If it was innocent, it wouldn't have mattered the Butler seeing.
并列句	And I know there's something going on-something political.
陈述句	The servants have been talking about it for days.
感叹句	Pan, we could prevent a murder!
陈述句	I've never heard such nonsense, he said shortly.
疑问句	How do you think you're going to keep still for four hours in this poky wardrobe?
并列句	Let me go and look in the corridor.
陈述句	I'll tell you when it's clear.
并列句	He fluttered from her shoulder, and she saw his little shadow appear in the crack of light.
陈述句	It's no good, Pan, I'm staying, she said.
并列句	There's another robe or something here.
并列句	I'll put that on the floor and make myself comfortable.
陈述句	I've just got to see what they do.
陈述句	She had been crouching.
并列句	She carefully stood up, feeling around for the clothes hangers in order not to make a noise, and found that the wardrobe was bigger than she'd thought.
并列句	There were several academic robes and hoods, some with fur around them, most faced with silk.
条件状语从句	I wonder if these are all the Master's?
陈述句	she whispered.
并列句	When he gets honorary degrees from other places, perhaps they give him fancy robes and he keeps them here for dressing-up....Pan, do you really think it's not poison in that wine?
陈述句	No, he said.
陈述句	I think it is, like you do.
并列句	And I think it's none of our business.
并列句	And I think it would be the silliest thing you've ever done in a lifetime of silly things to interfere.
陈述句	It's nothing to do with us.
陈述句	Don't be stupid, Lyra said.
并列句	I can't sit in here and watch them give him poison!
陈述句	Come somewhere else, then.
陈述句	You're a coward, Pan.
陈述句	Certainly I am.
疑问句	May I ask what you intend to do?
并列句	Are you going to leap out and snatch the glass from his trembling fingers?
疑问句	What did you have in mind?
并列句	I didn't have anything in mind, and well you know it, she snapped quietly.
并列句	But now I've seen what the Master did, I haven't got any choice.
疑问句	You're supposed to know about conscience, aren't you?
并列句	How can I just go and sit in the library or somewhere and twiddle my thumbs, knowing what's going to happen?
陈述句	I don't intend to do that, I promise you.
陈述句	This is what you wanted all the time, he said after a moment.
并列句	You wanted to hide in here and watch.
疑问句	Why didn't I realize that before?
陈述句	All right, I do, she said.
陈述句	Everyone knows they get up to something secret.
并列句	They have a ritual or something.
并列句	And I just wanted to know what it was.
感叹句	It's none of your business!
并列句	If they want to enjoy their little secrets you should just feel superior and let them get on with it.
并列句	Hiding and spying is for silly children.
陈述句	Exactly what I knew you'd say.
陈述句	Now stop nagging.
并列句	The two of them sat in silence for a while, Lyra uncomfortable on the hard floor of the wardrobe and Pantalaimon self-righteously twitching his temporary antennae on one of the robes.
并列句	Lyra felt a mixture of thoughts contending in her head, and she would have liked nothing better than to share them with her daemon, but she was proud too.
陈述句	Perhaps she should try to clear them up without his help.
并列句	Her main thought was anxiety, and it wasn't for herself.
陈述句	She'd been in trouble often enough to be used to it.
并列句	This time she was anxious about Lord Asriel, and about what this all meant.
并列句	It wasn't often that he visited the college, and the fact that this was a time of high political tension meant that he hadn't come simply to eat and drink and smoke with a few old friends.
并列句	She knew that both Lord Asriel and the Master were members of the Cabinet Council, the Prime Minister's special advisory body, so it might have been something to do with that; but meetings of the Cabinet Council were held in the palace, not in the Retiring Room of Jordan College.
陈述句	Then there was the rumor that had been keeping the College servants whispering for days.
并列句	It was said that the Tartars had invaded Muscovy, and were surging north to St. Petersburg, from where they would be able to dominate the Baltic Sea and eventually overcome the entire west of Europe.
并列句	And Lord Asriel had been in the far North: when she'd seen him last, he was preparing an expedition to Lapland... Pan, she whispered.
疑问句	Yes?
疑问句	Do you think there'll be a war?
陈述句	Not yet.
并列句	Lord Asriel wouldn't be dining here if it was going to break out in the next week or so.
陈述句	That's what I thought.
并列句	But later?
感叹句	Shh!
陈述句	Someone's coming.
并列句	She sat up and put her eye to the crack of the door.
陈述句	It was the Butler, coming to trim the lamp as the Master had ordered him to.
并列句	The common room and the library were lit by anbar-ic power, but the Scholars preferred the older, softer naphtha lamps in the Retiring Room.
陈述句	They wouldn't change that in the Master's lifetime.
并列句	The Butler trimmed the wick, and put another log on the fire as well, and then listened carefully at the hall door before helping himself to a handful of leaf from the smoking stand.
陈述句	He had hardly replaced the lid when the handle of the other door turned, making him jump nervously.
陈述句	Lyra tried not to laugh.
并列句	The Butler hastily stuffed the leaf into his pocket and turned to face the incomer.
感叹句	Lord Asriel!
并列句	he said, and a shiver of cold surprise ran down Lyra's back.
并列句	She couldn't see him from where she was, and she tried to smother the urge to move and look.
陈述句	Good evening, Wren, said Lord Asriel.
并列句	Lyra always heard that harsh voice with a mixture of pleasure and apprehension.
陈述句	I arrived too late to dine.
陈述句	I'll wait in here.
陈述句	The Butler looked uncomfortable.
并列句	Guests entered the Retiring Room at the Master's invitation only, and Lord Asriel knew that; but the Butler also saw Lord Asriel looking pointedly at the bulge in his pocket, and decided not to protest.
疑问句	Shall I let the Master know you've arrived, my lord?
陈述句	No harm in that.
陈述句	You might bring me some coffee.
陈述句	Very good, my lord.
并列句	The Butler bowed and hastened out, his daemon trotting submissively at his heels.
并列句	Lyra's uncle moved across to the fire and stretched his arms high above his head, yawning like a lion.
陈述句	He was wearing traveling clothes.
陈述句	Lyra was reminded, as she always was when she saw him again, of how much he frightened her.
并列句	There was no question now of creeping out unnoticed: she'd have to sit tight and hope.
陈述句	Lord Asriel's daemon, a snow leopard, stood behind him.
疑问句	Are you going to show the projections in here?
陈述句	she said quietly.
陈述句	Yes.
陈述句	It'll create less fuss than moving to the lecture theater.
陈述句	They'll want to see the specimens too; I'll send for the Porter in a minute.
陈述句	This is a bad time, Stelmaria.
陈述句	You should rest.
陈述句	He stretched out in one of the armchairs, so that Lyra could no longer see his face.
陈述句	Yes, yes.
陈述句	I should also change my clothes.
陈述句	There's probably some ancient etiquette that allows them to fine me a dozen bottles for coming in here dressed improperly.
陈述句	I should sleep for three days.
并列句	The fact remains that- There was a knock, and the Butler came in with a silver tray bearing a coffeepot and a cup.
陈述句	Thank you, Wren, said Lord Asriel.
疑问句	Is that the Tokay I can see on the table?
陈述句	The Master ordered it decanted especially for you, my I lord, said the Butler.
陈述句	There are only three dozen bottles left I of the'98.
陈述句	All good things pass away.
陈述句	Leave the tray here beside me.
疑问句	Oh, ask the Porter to send up the two cases I left in the Lodge, would you?
疑问句	Here, my lord?
陈述句	Yes, here, man.
并列句	And I shall need a screen and a projecting lantern, also here, also now.
并列句	The Butler could hardly prevent himself from opening his mouth in surprise, but managed to suppress the question, or the protest.
陈述句	Wren, you're forgetting your place, said Lord Asriel.
陈述句	Don't question me; just do as I tell you.
陈述句	Very good, my lord, said the Butler.
并列句	If I may suggest it, I should perhaps let Mr. Cawson know what you're planning, my lord, or else he'll be somewhat taken aback, if you see what I mean.
陈述句	Yes.
陈述句	Tell him, then.
陈述句	Mr. Cawson was the Steward.
并列句	There was an old and well-established rivalry between him and the Butler.
并列句	The Steward was the superior, but the Butler had more opportunities to ingratiate himself with the Scholars, and made full use of them.
陈述句	He would be delighted to have this chance of showing the Steward that he knew more about what was going on in the Retiring Room.
并列句	He bowed and left.
并列句	Lyra watched as her uncle poured a cup of coffee, drained it at once, and poured another before sipping more slowly.
疑问句	She was agog: cases of specimens?
疑问句	A projecting lantern?
并列句	What did he have to show the Scholars that was so urgent and important?
并列句	Then Lord Asriel stood up and turned away from the fire.
并列句	She saw him fully, and marveled at the contrast he made with the plump Butler, the stooped and languid Scholars.
并列句	Lord Asriel was a tall man with powerful shoulders, a fierce dark face, and eyes that seemed to flash and glitter with savage laughter.
并列句	It was a face to be dominated by, or to fight: never a face to patronize or pity.
并列句	All his movements were large and perfectly balanced, like those of a wild animal, and when he appeared in a room like this, he seemed a wild animal held in a cage too small for it.
并列句	At the moment his expression was distant and preoccupied.
并列句	His daemon came close and leaned her head on his waist, and he looked down at her unfathomably before turning away and walking to the table.
并列句	Lyra suddenly felt her stomach lurch, for Lord Asriel had taken the stopper from the decanter of Tokay, and was pouring a glass.
感叹句	No!
陈述句	The quiet cry came before she could hold it back.
并列句	Lord Asriel heard and turned at once.
疑问句	Who's there?
陈述句	She couldn't help herself.
并列句	She tumbled out of the wardrobe and scrambled up to snatch the glass from his hand.
并列句	The wine flew out, splashing on the edge of the table and the carpet, and then the glass fell and smashed.
并列句	He seized her wrist and twisted hard.
感叹句	Lyra!
疑问句	What the hell are you doing?
并列句	Let go of me and I'll tell you!
陈述句	I'll break your arm first.
疑问句	How dare you come in here?
感叹句	I've just saved your life!
并列句	They were still for a moment, the girl twisted in pain but grimacing to prevent herself from crying out louder, the man bent over her frowning like thunder.
疑问句	What did you say?
陈述句	he said more quietly.
陈述句	That wine is poisoned, she muttered between clenched teeth.
陈述句	I saw the Master put some powder in it.
陈述句	He let go.
并列句	She sank to the floor, and Pantalaimon fluttered anxiously to her shoulder.
并列句	Her uncle looked down with a restrained fury, and she didn't dare meet his eyes.
陈述句	I came in just to see what the room was like, she said.
陈述句	I know I shouldn't have.
并列句	But I was going to go out before anyone came in, except that I heard the Master coming and got ^ trapped.
陈述句	The wardrobe was the only place to hide.
并列句	And I saw him put the powder in the wine.
条件状语从句	If I hadn't...
陈述句	There was a knock on the door.
陈述句	That'll be the Porter, said Lord Asriel.
陈述句	Back in the wardrobe.
条件状语从句	If I hear the slightest noise, I'll make you wish you were dead.
并列句	She darted back there at once, and no sooner had she pulled the door shut than Lord Asriel called, Come in.
陈述句	As he'd said, it was the Porter.
疑问句	In here, my lord?
并列句	Lyra saw the old man standing doubtfully in the doorway, and behind him, the corner of a large wooden box.
陈述句	That's right, Shuter, said Lord Asriel.
并列句	Bring them both in and put them down by the table.
并列句	Lyra relaxed a little, and allowed herself to feel the pain in her shoulder and wrist.
条件状语从句	It might have been enough to make her cry, if she was the sort of girl who cried.
并列句	Instead she gritted her teeth and moved the arm gently until it felt looser.
并列句	Then came a crash of glass and the glug of spilled liquid.
感叹句	Damn you, Shuter, you careless old fool!
感叹句	Look what you've done!
陈述句	Lyra could see, just.
并列句	Her uncle had managed to knock the decanter of Tokay off the table, and made it look as if the Porter had done it.
并列句	The old man put the box down carefully and began to apologize.
陈述句	I'm truly sorry, my lord-I must have been closer than I thought- Get something to clear this mess up.
感叹句	Go on, before it soaks into the carpet!
陈述句	The Porter hurried out.
并列句	Lord Asriel moved closer to the wardrobe and spoke in an undertone.
陈述句	Since you're in there, you can make yourself useful.
陈述句	Watch the Master closely when he comes in.
条件状语从句	If you tell me something interesting about him, I'll keep you from getting further into the trouble you're already in.
疑问句	Understand?
陈述句	Yes, Uncle.
并列句	Make a noise in there and I won't help you.
陈述句	You're on your own.
并列句	He moved away and stood with his back to the fire again as the Porter came back with a brush and dustpan for the glass and a bowl and cloth.
陈述句	I can only say once again, my lord, I do most earnestly beg your pardon; I don't know what- Just clear up the mess.
并列句	As the Porter began to mop the wine from the carpet, the Butler knocked and came in with Lord Asriel's manservant, a man called Thorold.
陈述句	They were carrying between them a heavy case of polished wood with brass handles.
并列句	They saw what the Porter was doing and stopped dead.
陈述句	Yes, it was the Tokay, said Lord Asriel.
陈述句	Too bad.
疑问句	Is that the lantern?
条件状语从句	Set it up by the wardrobe, Thorold, if you would.
陈述句	I'll have the screen up at the other end.
并列句	Lyra realized that she would be able to see the screen and whatever was on it through the crack in the door, and wondered whether her uncle had arranged it like that for the purpose.
并列句	Under the noise the manservant made unrolling the stiff linen and setting it up on its frame, she whispered: See?
疑问句	It was worth coming, wasn't it?
陈述句	It might be, Pantalaimon said austerely, in his tiny moth voice.
并列句	And it might not.
并列句	Lord Asriel stood by the fire sipping the last of the coffee and watching darkly as Thorold opened the case of the projecting lantern and uncapped the lens before checking the oil tank.
陈述句	There's plenty of oil, my lord, he said.
疑问句	Shall I send for a technician to operate it?
陈述句	No.
陈述句	I'll do it myself.
陈述句	Thank you, Thorold.
疑问句	Have they finished dinner yet, Wren?
陈述句	Very nearly, I think, my lord, replied the Butler.
并列句	If I understand Mr. Cawson aright, the Master and his guests won't be disposed to linger once they know you're here.
疑问句	Shall I take the coffee tray?
并列句	Take it and go.
陈述句	Very good, my lord.
并列句	With a slight bow, the Butler took the tray and left, and Thorold went with him.
并列句	As soon as the door closed, Lord Asriel looked across the room directly at the wardrobe, and Lyra felt the force of his glance almost as if it had physical form, as if it were an arrow or a spear.
并列句	Then he looked away and spoke softly to his dasmon.
并列句	She came to sit calmly at his side, alert and elegant and dangerous, her tawny eyes surveying the room before turning, like his black ones, to the door from the hall as the handle turned.
并列句	Lyra couldn't see the door, but she heard an intake of breath as the first man came in.
陈述句	TWO  THE IDEA OF NORTH   Master, said Lord Asriel.
陈述句	Yes, I'm back.
陈述句	Do bring in your guests; I've got something very interesting to show you.
并列句	Lord Asriel, said the Master heavily, and came forward to shake his hand.
并列句	From her hiding place Lyra watched the Master's eyes, and indeed, they flicked toward the table for a second, where the Tokay had been.
陈述句	Master, said Lord Asriel.
陈述句	I came too late to disturb your dinner, so I made myself at home in here.
陈述句	Hello, Sub-Rector.
陈述句	Glad to see you looking so well.
陈述句	Excuse my rough appearance; I've only just landed.
陈述句	Yes, Master, the Tokay's gone.
陈述句	I think you're standing in it.
并列句	The Porter knocked it off the table, but it was my fault.
陈述句	Hello, Chaplain.
陈述句	I read your latest paper with great interest.
陈述句	He moved away with the Chaplain, leaving Lyra with a clear view of the Master's face.
并列句	It was impassive, but the daemon on his shoulder was shuffling her feathers and moving restlessly from foot to foot.
并列句	Lord Asriel was already dominating the room, and although he was careful to be courteous to the Master in the Master's own territory, it was clear where the power lay.
并列句	The Scholars greeted the visitor and moved into the room, some sitting around the table, some in the armchairs, and soon a buzz of conversation filled the air.
并列句	Lyra could see that they were powerfully intrigued by the wooden case, the screen, and the lantern.
并列句	She knew the Scholars well: the Librarian, the Sub-Rector, the Enquirer, and the rest; they were men who had been around her all her life, taught her, chastised her, consoled her, given her little presents, chased her away from the fruit trees in the garden; they were all she had for a family.
条件状语从句	They might even have felt like a family if she knew what a family was, though if she did, she'd have been more likely to feel that about the College servants.
陈述句	The Scholars had more important things to do than attend to the affections of a half-wild, half-civilized girl, left among them by chance.
并列句	The Master lit the spirit lamp under the little silver chafing dish and heated some butter before cutting half a dozen poppy heads open and tossing them in.
并列句	Poppy was always served after a feast: it clarified the mind and stimulated the tongue, and made for rich conversation.
陈述句	It was traditional for the Master to cook it himself.
并列句	Under the sizzle of the frying butter and the hum of talk, Lyra shifted around to find a more comfortable position for herself.
并列句	With enormous care she took one of the robes-a full-length fur-off its hanger and laid it on the floor of the wardrobe.
陈述句	You should have used a scratchy old one, whispered Pantalaimon.
条件状语从句	If you get too comfortable, you'll go to sleep.
条件状语从句	If I do, it's your job to wake me up, she replied.
并列句	She sat and listened to the talk.
并列句	Mighty dull talk it was, too; almost all of it politics, and London politics at that, nothing exciting about Tartars.
并列句	The smells of frying poppy and smoke-leaf drifted pleasantly in through the wardrobe door, and more than once Lyra found herself nodding.
并列句	But finally she heard someone rap on the table.
并列句	The voices fell silent, and then the Master spoke.
陈述句	Gentlemen, he said.
陈述句	I feel sure I speak for all of us when I bid Lord Asriel welcome.
并列句	His visits are rare but always immensely valuable, and I understand he has something of particular interest to show us tonight.
并列句	This is a time of high political tension, as we are all aware; Lord Asriel's presence is required early tomorrow morning in White Hall, and a train is waiting with steam up ready to carry him to London as soon as we have finished our conversation here; so we must use our time wisely.
陈述句	When he has finished speaking to us, I imagine there will be some questions.
并列句	Please keep them brief and to the point.
疑问句	Lord Asriel, would you like to begin?
陈述句	Thank you, Master, said Lord Asriel.
陈述句	To start with, I have a few slides to show you.
陈述句	Sub-Rector, you can see best from here, I think.
疑问句	Perhaps the Master would like to take the chair near the wardrobe?
陈述句	Lyra marveled at her uncle's skill.
并列句	The old Sub-Rector was nearly blind, so it was courteous to make room for him nearer the screen, and his moving forward meant that the Master would be sitting next to the Librarian, only a matter of a yard or so from where Lyra was crouched in the wardrobe.
感叹句	As the Master settled in the armchair, Lyra heard him murmur: The devil!
陈述句	He knew about the wine, I'm sure of it.
陈述句	The Librarian murmured back, He's going to ask for funds.
条件状语从句	If he forces a vote- If he does that, we must just argue against, with all the eloquence we have.
陈述句	The lantern began to hiss as Lord Asriel pumped it hard.
陈述句	Lyra moved slightly so that she could see the screen, where a brilliant white circle had begun to glow.
疑问句	Lord Asriel called, Could someone turn the lamp down?
并列句	One of the Scholars got up to do that, and the room darkened.
陈述句	Lord Asriel began: As some of you know, I set out for the North twelve months ago on a diplomatic mission to the King of Lapland.
陈述句	At least, that's what I pretended to be doing.
并列句	In fact, my real aim was to go further north still, right on to the ice, in fact, to try and discover what had happened to the Grumman expedition.
陈述句	One of Grumman's last messages to the academy in Berlin spoke of a certain natural phenomenon only seen in the lands of the North.
陈述句	I was determined to investigate that as well as find out what I could about Grumman.
并列句	But the first picture I'm going to show you isn't directly about either of those things.
并列句	And he put the first slide into the frame and slid it behind the lens.
并列句	A circular photogram in sharp black and white appeared on the screen.
并列句	It had been taken at night under a full moon, and it showed a wooden hut in the middle distance, its walls dark against the snow that surrounded it and lay thickly on the roof.
并列句	Beside the hut stood an array of philosophical instruments, which looked to Lyra's eye like something from the Anbaric Park on the road to Yarnton: aerials, wires, porcelain insulators, all glittering in the moonlight and thickly covered in frost.
条件状语从句	A man in furs, his face hardly visible in the deep hood of his garment, stood in the foreground, with his hand raised as if in greeting.
陈述句	To one side of him stood a smaller figure.
陈述句	The moonlight bathed everything in the same pallid gleam.
陈述句	That photogram was taken with a standard silver nitrate emulsion, Lord Asriel said.
陈述句	I'd like you to look at another one, taken from the same spot only a minute later, with a new specially prepared emulsion.
并列句	He lifted out the first slide and dropped another into the frame.
条件状语从句	This was much darker; it was as if the moonlight had been filtered out.
并列句	The horizon was still visible, with the dark shape of the hut and its light snow-covered roof standing out, but the complexity of the instruments was hidden in darkness.
并列句	But the man had altogether changed: he was bathed in light, and a fountain of glowing particles seemed to be streaming from his upraised hand.
并列句	That light, said the Chaplain, is it going up or coming down?
并列句	It's coming down, said Lord Asriel, but it isn't light.
陈述句	It's Dust.
条件状语从句	Something in the way he said it made Lyra imagine dust with a capital letter, as if this wasn't ordinary dust.
原因状语从句	The reaction of the Scholars confirmed her feeling, because Lord Asriel's words caused a sudden collective silence, followed by gasps of incredulity.
并列句	But how- Surely- It can't- Gentlemen!
陈述句	came the voice of the Chaplain.
陈述句	Let Lord Asriel explain.
陈述句	It's Dust, Lord Asriel repeated.
原因状语从句	It registered as light on the plate because particles of Dust affect this emulsion as photons affect silver nitrate emulsion.
陈述句	It was partly to test it that my expedition went north in the first place.
陈述句	As you see, the figure of the man is perfectly visible.
陈述句	Now I'd like you to look at the shape to his left.
陈述句	He indicated the blurred shape of the smaller figure.
陈述句	I thought that was the man's daemon, said the Enquirer.
陈述句	No.
陈述句	His daemon was at the time coiled around his neck in the form of a snake.
陈述句	That shape you can dimly see is a child.
疑问句	A severed child-?
并列句	said someone, and the way he stopped showed that he knew this was something that shouldn't have been voiced.
陈述句	There was an intense silence.
陈述句	Then Lord Asriel said calmly, An entire child.
疑问句	Which, given the nature of Dust, is precisely the point, is it not?
陈述句	No one spoke for several seconds.
陈述句	Then came the voice of the Chaplain.
陈述句	Ah, he said, like a thirsty man who, having just drunk deeply, puts down the glass to let out the breath he has held while drinking.
并列句	And the streams of Dust... -Come from the sky, and bathe him in what looks like light.
陈述句	You may examine this picture as closely as you wish: I'll leave it behind when I go.
陈述句	I'm showing it to you now to demonstrate the effect of this new emulsion.
陈述句	Now I'd like to show you another picture.
陈述句	He changed the slide.
并列句	The next picture was also taken at night, but this time without moonlight.
并列句	It showed a small group of tents in the foreground, dimly outlined against the low horizon, and beside them an untidy heap of wooden boxes and a sledge.
并列句	But the main interest of the picture lay in the sky.
并列句	Streams and veils of light hung like curtains, looped and festooned on invisible hooks hundreds of miles high or blowing out sideways in the stream of some unimaginable wind.
疑问句	What is that?
陈述句	said the voice of the Sub-Rector.
陈述句	It's a picture of the Aurora.
陈述句	It's a very fine photogram, said the Palmerian Professor.
陈述句	One of the best I've seen.
并列句	Forgive my ignorance, said the shaky voice of the old Precentor, but if I ever knew what the Aurora was, I have forgotten.
疑问句	Is it what they call the Northern Lights?
陈述句	Yes.
陈述句	It has many names.
并列句	It's composed of storms of charged particles and solar rays of intense and extraordinary strength-invisible in themselves, but causing this luminous radiation when they interact with the atmosphere.
并列句	If there'd been time, I would have had this slide tinted to show you the colors; pale green and rose, for the most part, with a tinge of crimson along the lower edge of that curtain-like formation.
陈述句	This is taken with ordinary emulsion.
陈述句	Now I'd like you to look at a picture taken with the special emulsion.
陈述句	He took out the slide.
条件状语从句	Lyra heard the Master say quietly, If he forces a vote, we could try to invoke the residence clause.
陈述句	He hasn't been resident in the College for thirty weeks out of the last fifty-two.
陈述句	He's already got the Chaplain on his side... the Librarian murmured in reply.
陈述句	Lord Asriel put a new slide in the lantern frame.
陈述句	It showed the same scene.
并列句	As with the previous pair of pictures, many of the features visible by ordinary light were much dimmer in this one, and so were the curtains of radiance in the sky.
并列句	But in the middle of the Aurora, high above the bleak landscape, Lyra could see something solid.
并列句	She pressed her face to the crack to see more clearly, and she could see the Scholars near the screen leaning forward too.
原因状语从句	As she gazed, her wonder grew, because there in the sky was the unmistakable outline of a city: towers, domes, walls...Buildings and streets, suspended in the air!
陈述句	She nearly gasped with wonder.
陈述句	The Cassington Scholar said, That looks like...a city.
陈述句	Exactly so, said Lord Asriel.
疑问句	A city in another world, no doubt?
陈述句	said the Dean, with contempt in his voice.
陈述句	Lord Asriel ignored him.
条件状语从句	There was a stir of excitement among some of the Scholars, as if, having written treatises on the existence of the unicorn without ever having seen one, they'd been presented with a living example newly captured.
疑问句	Is this the Barnard-Stokes business?
陈述句	said the Palmerian Professor.
疑问句	It is, isn't it?
陈述句	That's what I want to find out, said Lord Asriel.
陈述句	He stood to one side of the illuminated screen.
并列句	Lyra could see his dark eyes searching among the Scholars as they peered up at the slide of the Aurora, and the green glow of his demon's eyes beside him.
并列句	All the venerable heads were craning forward, their spectacles glinting; only the Master and the Librarian leaned back in their chairs, with their heads close together.
陈述句	The Chaplain was saying, You said you were searching for news of the Grumman expedition, Lord Asriel.
疑问句	Was Dr. Grumman investigating this phenomenon too?
并列句	I believe he was, and I believe he had a good deal of information about it.
原因状语从句	But he won't be able to tell us what it was, because he's dead.
感叹句	No!
陈述句	said the Chaplain.
并列句	I'm afraid so, and I have the proof here.
并列句	A ripple of excited apprehension ran round the Retiring Room as, under Lord Asriel's direction, two or three of the younger Scholars carried the wooden box to the front of the room.
并列句	Lord Asriel took out the last slide but left the lantern on, and in the dramatic glare of the circle of light he bent to lever open the box.
陈述句	Lyra heard the screech of nails coming out of damp wood.
陈述句	The Master stood up to look, blocking Lyra's view.
条件状语从句	Her uncle spoke again: If you remember, Grumman's expedition vanished eighteen months ago.
并列句	The German Academy sent him up there to go as far north as the magnetic pole and make various celestial observations.
陈述句	It was in the course of that journey that he observed the curious phenomenon we've already seen.
陈述句	Shortly after that, he vanished.
并列句	It's been assumed that he had an accident and that his body's been lying in a crevasse all this time.
陈述句	In fact, there was no accident.
疑问句	What have you got there?
陈述句	said the Dean.
疑问句	Is that a vacuum container?
陈述句	Lord Asriel didn't answer at first.
并列句	Lyra heard the snap of metal clips and a hiss as air rushed into a vessel, and then there was a silence.
并列句	But the silence didn't last long.
并列句	After a moment or two Lyra heard a confused babble break out: cries of horror, loud protests, voices raised in anger and fear.
并列句	But what- -hardly human- -it's been- -what's happened to it?
陈述句	The Master's voice cut through them all.
疑问句	Lord Asriel, what in God's name have you got there?
陈述句	This is the head of Stanislaus Grumman, said Lord Asriel's voice.
并列句	Over the jumble of voices Lyra heard someone stumble to the door and out, making incoherent sounds of distress.
陈述句	She wished she could see what they were seeing.
陈述句	Lord Asriel said, I found his body preserved in the ice off Svalbard.
陈述句	The head was treated in this way by his killers.
陈述句	You'll notice the characteristic scalping pattern.
陈述句	I think you might be familiar with it, Sub-Rector.
陈述句	The old man's voice was steady as he said, I have seen the Tartars do this.
并列句	It's a technique you find among the aboriginals of Siberia and the Tungusk.
让步状语从句	From there, of course, it spread into the lands of the Skraelings, though I understand that it is now banned in New Denmark.
疑问句	May I examine it more closely, Lord Asriel?
陈述句	After a short silence he spoke again.
并列句	My eyes are not very clear, and the ice is dirty, but it seems to me that there is a hole in the top of the skull.
疑问句	Am I right?
陈述句	You are.
疑问句	Trepanning?
陈述句	Exactly.
陈述句	That caused a murmur of excitement.
并列句	The Master moved out of the way and Lyra could see again.
并列句	The old Sub-Rector, in the circle of light thrown by the lantern, was holding a heavy block of ice up close to his eyes, and Lyra could see the object inside it: a bloody lump barely recognizable as a human head.
陈述句	Pantalaimon fluttered around Lyra, his distress affecting her.
陈述句	Hush, she whispered.
陈述句	Listen.
陈述句	Dr. Grumman was once a Scholar of this College, said the Dean hotly.
并列句	To fall into the hands of the Tartars- But that far north?
感叹句	They must have penetrated further than anyone imagined!
疑问句	Did I hear you say you found it near Svalbard?
陈述句	said the Dean.
陈述句	That's right.
疑问句	Are we to understand that the panserbj0rne had anything to do with this?
并列句	Lyra didn't recognize that word, but clearly the Scholars did.
陈述句	Impossible, said the Cassington Scholar firmly.
陈述句	They'd never behave in that manner.
陈述句	Then you don't know lofur Raknison, said the Palmerian Professor, who had made several expeditions himself to the arctic regions.
陈述句	It wouldn't surprise me at all to learn that he had taken to scalping people in the Tartar fashion.
并列句	Lyra looked again at her uncle, who was watching the Scholars with a glitter of sardonic amusement, and saying nothing.
疑问句	Who is lofur Raknison?
陈述句	said someone.
陈述句	The king of Svalbard, said the Palmerian Professor.
陈述句	Yes, that's right, one of the panserb)0me.
并列句	He's a usurper, of sorts; tricked his way onto the throne, or so I understand; but a powerful figure, by no means a fool, in spite of his ludicrous affectations-having a palace built of imported marble-setting up what he calls a university- For whom?
疑问句	For the bears?
并列句	said someone else, and every-one laughed.
并列句	But the Palmerian Professor went on: For all that, I tell you that lofur Raknison would be capable of doing this to Grumman.
条件状语从句	At the same time, he could be flattered into behaving quite differently, if the need arose.
并列句	And you know how, do you, Trelawney?
陈述句	said the Dean sneeringly.
陈述句	Indeed I do.
疑问句	Do you know what he wants above all else?
疑问句	Even more than an honorary degree?
感叹句	He wants a daemon!
并列句	Find a way to give him a daemon, and he'd do anything for you.
陈述句	The Scholars laughed heartily.
陈述句	Lyra was following this with puzzlement; what the Palmerian Professor said made no sense at all.
并列句	Besides, she was impatient to hear more about scalping and the Northern Lights and that mysterious Dust.
并列句	But she was disappointed, for Lord Asriel had finished showing his relics and pictures, and the talk soon turned into a College wrangle about whether or not they should give him some money to fit out another expedition.
并列句	Back and forth the arguments ranged, and Lyra felt her eyes closing.
陈述句	Soon she was fast asleep, with Pantalaimon curled around her neck in his favorite sleeping form as an ermine.
陈述句	She woke up with a start when someone shook her shoulder.
陈述句	Quiet, said her uncle.
并列句	The wardrobe door was open, and he was crouched there against the light.
并列句	They've all gone, but there are still some servants around.
并列句	Go to your bedroom now, and take care that you say nothing about this.
疑问句	Did they vote to give you the money?
陈述句	she said sleepily.
陈述句	Yes.
疑问句	What's Dust?
陈述句	she said, struggling to stand up after having been cramped for so long.
陈述句	Nothing to do with you.
陈述句	It is to do with me, she said.
条件状语从句	If you wanted me to be a spy in the wardrobe, you ought to tell me what I'm spying about.
疑问句	Can I see the man's head?
陈述句	Pantalaimon's white ermine fur bristled: she felt it tickling her neck.
陈述句	Lord Asriel laughed shortly.
并列句	Don't be disgusting, he said, and began to pack his slides and specimen box.
疑问句	Did you watch the Master?
并列句	Yes, and he looked for the wine before he did anything else.
陈述句	Good.
并列句	But I've scotched him for now.
并列句	Do as you're told and go to bed.
并列句	But where are you going?
陈述句	Back to the North.
陈述句	I'm leaving in ten minutes.
疑问句	Can I come?
并列句	He stopped what he was doing, and looked at her as if for the first time.
并列句	His daemon turned her great tawny leopard eyes on her too, and under the concentrated gaze of both of them, Lyra blushed.
并列句	But she gazed back fiercely.
陈述句	Your place is here, said her uncle finally.
并列句	But why?
疑问句	Why is my place here?
疑问句	Why can't I come to the North with you?
并列句	I want to see the Northern Lights and bears and icebergs and everything.
陈述句	I want to know about Dust.
并列句	And that city in the air.
疑问句	Is it another world?
陈述句	You're not coming, child.
陈述句	Put it out of your head; the times are too dangerous.
并列句	Do as you're told and go to bed, and if you're a good girl, I'll bring you back a walrus tusk with some Eskimo carving on it.
并列句	Don't argue anymore or I shall be angry.
并列句	And his daemon growled with a deep savage rumble that made Lyra suddenly aware of what it would be like to have teeth meeting in her throat.
并列句	She compressed her lips and frowned hard at her uncle.
并列句	He was pumping the air from the vacuum flask, and took no notice; it was as if he'd already forgotten her.
并列句	Without a word, but with lips tight and eyes narrowed, the girl and her daemon left and went to bed.
并列句	* * *  The Master and the Librarian were old friends and allies, and it was their habit, after a difficult episode, to take a glass of brantwijn and console each other.
并列句	So after they'd seen Lord Asriel away, they strolled to the Master's lodging and settled in his study with the curtains drawn and the fire refreshed, their daemons in their familiar places on knee or shoulder, and prepared to think through what had just happened.
疑问句	Do you really believe he knew about the wine?
陈述句	said the Librarian.
陈述句	Of course he did.
并列句	I have no idea how, but he knew, and he spilled the decanter himself.
陈述句	Of course he did.
并列句	Forgive me, Master, but I can't help being relieved.
疑问句	I was never happy about the idea of... Of poisoning him?
陈述句	Yes.
陈述句	Of murder.
陈述句	Hardly anyone would be happy at that idea, Charles.
陈述句	The question was whether doing that would be worse than the consequences of not doing it.
并列句	Well, some providence has intervened, and it hasn't happened.
陈述句	I'm only sorry I burdened you with the knowledge of it.
陈述句	No, no, protested the Librarian.
并列句	But I wish you had told me more.
陈述句	The Master was silent for a while before saying, Yes, perhaps I should have done.
条件状语从句	The alethiometer warns of appalling consequences if Lord Asriel pursues this research.
并列句	Apart from anything else, the child will be drawn in, and I want to keep her safe as long as possible.
疑问句	Is Lord Asriel's business anything to do with this new initiative of the Consistorial Court of Discipline?
疑问句	The what-do-they-call-it: the Oblation Board?
陈述句	Lord Asriel-no, no.
陈述句	Quite the reverse.
陈述句	The Oblation Board isn't entirely answerable to the Consistorial Court, either.
陈述句	It's a semiprivate initiative; it's being run by someone who has no love of Lord Asriel.
陈述句	Between them both, Charles, I tremble.
陈述句	The Librarian was silent in his turn.
并列句	Ever since Pope John Calvin had moved the seat of the Papacy to Geneva and set up the Consistorial Court of Discipline, the Church's power over every aspect of life had been absolute.
并列句	The Papacy itself had been abolished after Calvin's death, and a tangle of courts, colleges, and councils, collectively known as the Magisterium, had grown up in its place.
陈述句	These agencies were not always united; sometimes a bitter rivalry grew up between them.
并列句	For a large part of the previous century, the most powerful had been the College of Bishops, but in recent years the Consistorial Court of Discipline had taken its place as the most active and the most feared of all the Church's bodies.
并列句	But it was always possible for independent agencies to grow up under the protection of another part of the Magisterium, and the Oblation Board, which the Librarian had referred to, was one of these.
并列句	The Librarian didn't know much about it, but he disliked and feared what he'd heard, and he completely understood the Master's anxiety.
并列句	The Palmerian Professor mentioned a name, he said after a minute or so.
疑问句	Barnard-Stokes?
疑问句	What is the Barnard-Stokes business?
陈述句	Ah, it's not our field, Charles.
并列句	As I understand it, the Holy Church teaches that there are two worlds: the world of everything we can see and hear and touch, and another world, the spiritual world of heaven and hell.
并列句	Barnard and Stokes were two-how shall I put it-renegade theologians who postulated the existence of numerous other worlds like this one, neither heaven nor hell, but material and sinful.
并列句	They are there, close by, but invisible and unreachable.
并列句	The Holy Church naturally disapproved of this abominable heresy, and Barnard and Stokes were silenced.
并列句	But unfortunately for the Magisterium there seem to be sound mathematical arguments for this other-world theory.
并列句	I have never followed them myself, but the Cassington Scholar tells me that they are sound.
并列句	And now Lord Asriel has taken a picture of one of these other worlds, the Librarian said.
并列句	And we have funded him to go and look for it.
陈述句	I see.
陈述句	Quite.
并列句	It'll seem to the Oblation Board, and to its powerful protectors, that Jordan College is a hotbed of support for heresy.
并列句	And between the Consistorial Court and the Oblation Board, Charles, I have to keep a balance; and meanwhile the child is growing.
陈述句	They won't have forgotten her.
并列句	Sooner or later she would have become involved, but she'll be drawn in now whether I want to protect her or not.
并列句	But how do you know that, for God's sake?
疑问句	The alethiometer again?
陈述句	Yes.
并列句	Lyra has a part to play in all this, and a major one.
陈述句	The irony is that she must do it all without realizing what she's doing.
并列句	She can be helped, though, and if my plan with the Tokay had succeeded, she would have been safe for a little longer.
陈述句	I would have liked to spare her a journey to the North.
陈述句	I wish above all things that I were able to explain it to her... She wouldn't listen, the Librarian said.
陈述句	I know her ways only too well.
并列句	Try to tell her anything serious and she'll half-listen for five minutes and then start fidgeting.
并列句	Quiz her about it next time and she'll have completely forgotten.
条件状语从句	If I talked to her about Dust?
疑问句	You don't think she'd listen to that?
陈述句	The Librarian made a noise to indicate how unlikely he thought that was.
疑问句	Why on earth should she?
陈述句	he said.
疑问句	Why should a distant theological riddle interest a healthy, thoughtless child?
原因状语从句	Because of what she must experience.
疑问句	Part of that includes a great betrayal.... Who's going to betray her?
并列句	No, no, that's the saddest thing: she will be the betrayer, and the experience will be terrible.
并列句	She mustn't know that, of course, but there's no reason for her not to know about the problem of Dust.
并列句	And you might be wrong, Charles; she might well take an interest in it, if it were explained in a simple way.
并列句	And it might help her later on.
陈述句	It would certainly help me to be less anxious about her.
陈述句	That's the duty of the old, said the Librarian, to be anxious on behalf of the young.
并列句	And the duty of the young is to scorn the anxiety of the old.
并列句	They sat for a while longer, and then parted, for it was late, and they were old and anxious.
并列句	THREE  LYRA'S JORDAN      Jordan College was the grandest and richest of all the colleges in Oxford.
让步状语从句	It was probably the largest, too, though no one knew for certain.
陈述句	The buildings, which were grouped around three irregular quadrangles, dated from every period from the early Middle Ages to the mid-eighteenth century.
并列句	It had never been planned; it had grown piecemeal, with past and present overlapping at every spot, and the final effect was one of jumbled and squalid grandeur.
并列句	Some part was always about to fall down, and for five generations the same family, the Parslows, had been employed full time by the College as masons and scaffolders.
并列句	The present Mr. Parslow was teaching his son the craft; the two of them and their three workmen would scramble like industrious termites over the scaffolding they'd erected at the corner of the library, or over the roof of the chapel, and haul up bright new blocks of stone or rolls of shiny lead or balks of timber.
并列句	The College owned farms and estates all over England.
并列句	It was said that you could walk from Oxford to Bristol in one direction and London in the other, and never leave Jordan land.
并列句	In every part of the kingdom there were dye works and brick kilns, forests and atomcraft works that paid rent to Jordan, and every quarter-day the bursar and his clerks would tot it all up, announce the total to Concilium, and order a pair of swans for the feast.
并列句	Some of the money was put by for reinvestment-Concilium had just approved the purchase of an office block in Manchester-and the rest was used to pay the Scholars' modest stipends and the wages of the servants (and the Parslows, and the other dozen or so families of craftsmen and traders who served the College), to keep the wine cellar richly filled, to buy books and anbarographs for the immense library that filled one side of the Melrose Quadrangle and extended, burrow-like, for several floors beneath the ground, and, not least, to buy the latest philosophical apparatus to equip the chapel.
原因状语从句	It was important to keep the chapel up to date, because Jordan College had no rival, either in Europe or in New France, as a center of experimental theology.
陈述句	Lyra knew that much, at least.
原因状语从句	She was proud of her College's eminence, and liked to boast of it to the various urchins and ragamuffins she played with by the canal or the claybeds; and she regarded visiting Scholars and eminent professors from elsewhere with pitying scorn, because they didn't belong to Jordan and so must know less, poor things, than the humblest of Jordan's under-Scholars.
陈述句	As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins.
并列句	She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really.
并列句	Probably the stars had daemons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them.
并列句	Lyra imagined the Chaplain speaking loftily, listening to the star daemons' remarks, and then nodding judiciously or shaking his head in regret.
并列句	But what might be passing between them, she couldn't conceive.
陈述句	Nor was she particularly interested.
陈述句	In many ways Lyra was a barbarian.
并列句	What she liked best was clambering over the College roofs with Roger, the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war.
并列句	Just as she was unaware of the hidden currents of politics running below the surface of College affairs, so the Scholars, for their part, would have been unable to see the rich seething stew of alliances and enmities and feuds and treaties which was a child's life in Oxford.
感叹句	Children playing together: how pleasant to see!
并列句	What could be more innocent and charming?
并列句	In fact, of course, Lyra and her peers were engaged in deadly warfare.
陈述句	There were several wars running at once.
并列句	The children (young servants, and the children of servants, and Lyra) of one college waged war on those of another.
并列句	Lyra had once been captured by the children of Gabriel College, and Roger and their friends Hugh Lovat and Simon Parslow had raided the place to rescue her, creeping through the Precentor's garden and gathering armfuls of small stone-hard plums to throw at the kidnappers.
并列句	There were twenty-four colleges, which allowed for endless permutations of alliance and betrayal.
并列句	But the enmity between the colleges was forgotten in a moment when the town children attacked a colleger: then all the collegers banded together and went into battle against the town-ies.This rivalry was hundreds of years old, and very deep and satisfying.
并列句	But even this was forgotten when the other enemies threatened.
并列句	One enemy was perennial: the brickburners' children, who lived by the claybeds and were despised by collegers and townies alike.
并列句	Last year Lyra and some townies had made a temporary truce and raided the claybeds, pelting the brick-burners' children with lumps of heavy clay and tipping over the soggy castle they'd built, before rolling them over and over in the clinging substance they lived by until victors and vanquished alike resembled a flock of shrieking golems.
陈述句	The other regular enemy was seasonal.
并列句	The gyptian families, who lived in canal boats, came and went with the spring and autumn fairs, and were always good for a fight.
陈述句	There was one family of gyptians in particular, who regularly returned to their mooring in that part of the city known as Jericho, with whom Lyra'd been feuding ever since she could first throw a stone.
并列句	When they were last in Oxford, she and Roger and some of the other kitchen boys from Jordan and St. Michael's College had laid an ambush for them, throwing mud at their brightly painted narrowboat until the whole family came out to chase them away-at which point the reserve squad under Lyra raided the boat and cast it off from the bank, to float down the canal, getting in the way of all the other water traffic while Lyra's raiders searched the boat from end to end, looking for the bung.
陈述句	Lyra firmly believed in this bung.
并列句	If they pulled it out, she assured her troop, the boat would sink at once; but they didn't find it, and had to abandon ship when the gyptians caught them up, to flee dripping and crowing with triumph through the narrow lanes of Jericho.
并列句	That was Lyra's world and her delight.
并列句	She was a coarse and greedy little savage, for the most part.
并列句	But she always had a dim sense that it wasn't her whole world; that part of her also belonged in the grandeur and ritual of Jordan College; and that somewhere in her life there was a connection with the high world of politics represented by Lord Asriel.
并列句	All she did with that knowledge was to give herself airs and lord it over the other urchins.
陈述句	It had never occurred to her to find out more.
陈述句	So she had passed her childhood, like a half-wild cat.
陈述句	The only variation in her days came on those irregular occasions when Lord Asriel visited the College.
并列句	A rich and powerful uncle was all very well to boast about, but the price of boasting was having to be caught by the most agile Scholar and brought to the Housekeeper to be washed and dressed in a clean frock, following which she was escorted (with many threats) to the Senior Common Room to have tea with Lord Asriel and an invited group of senior Scholars.
陈述句	She dreaded being seen by Roger.
并列句	He'd caught sight of her on one of these occasions and hooted with laughter at this beribboned and pink-frilled vision.
并列句	She had responded with a volley of shrieking curses that shocked the poor Scholar who was escorting her, and in the Senior Common Room she'd slumped mutinously in an armchair until the Master told her sharply to sit up, and then she'd glowered at them all till even the Chaplain had to laugh.
陈述句	What happened on those awkward, formal visits never varied.
并列句	After the tea, the Master and the other few Scholars who'd been invited left Lyra and her uncle together, and he called her to stand in front of him and tell him what she'd learned since his last visit.
并列句	And she would mutter whatever she could dredge up about geometry or Arabic or history or anbarology, and he would sit back with one ankle resting on the other knee and watch her inscrutably until her words failed.
并列句	Last year, before his expedition to the North, he'd gone on to say, And how do you spend your time when you're not diligently studying?
并列句	And she mumbled, I just play.
陈述句	Sort of around the College.
陈述句	Just...play, really.
并列句	And he said, Let me see your hands, child.
并列句	She held out her hands for inspection, and he took them and turned them over to look at her fingernails.
并列句	Beside him, his daemon lay sphinxlike on the carpet, swishing her tail occasionally and gazing unblinkingly at Lyra.
陈述句	Dirty, said Lord Asriel, pushing her hands away.
疑问句	Don't they make you wash in this place?
陈述句	Yes, she said.
并列句	But the Chaplain's fingernails are always dirty.
陈述句	They're even dirtier than mine.
陈述句	He's a learned man.
疑问句	What's your excuse?
陈述句	I must've got them dirty after I washed.
疑问句	Where do you play to get so dirty?
陈述句	She looked at him suspiciously.
让步状语从句	She had the feeling that being on the roof was forbidden, though no one had actually said so.
陈述句	In some of the old rooms, she said finally.
并列句	And where else?
陈述句	In the claybeds, sometimes.
并列句	And?
并列句	Jericho and Port Meadow.
疑问句	Nowhere else?
陈述句	No.
陈述句	You're a liar.
陈述句	I saw you on the roof only yesterday.
并列句	She bit her lip and said nothing.
陈述句	He was watching her sardonically.
陈述句	So, you play on the roof as well, he went on.
疑问句	Do you ever go into the library?
陈述句	No.
让步状语从句	I found a rook on the library roof, though, she went on.
疑问句	Did you?
疑问句	Did you catch it?
陈述句	It had a hurt foot.
并列句	I was going to kill it and roast it but Roger said we should help it get better.
并列句	So we gave it scraps of food and some wine and then it got better and flew away.
疑问句	Who's Roger?
陈述句	My friend.
陈述句	The kitchen boy.
陈述句	I see.
陈述句	So you've been all over the roof- Not all over.
原因状语从句	You can't get onto the Sheldon Building because you have to jump up from Pilgrim's Tower across a gap.
并列句	There's a skylight that opens onto it, but I'm not tall enough to reach it.
陈述句	You've been all over the roof except the Sheldon Building.
疑问句	What about underground?
疑问句	Underground?
陈述句	There's as much College below ground as there is above it.
陈述句	I'm surprised you haven't found that out.
陈述句	Well, I'm going in a minute.
陈述句	You look healthy enough.
陈述句	Here.
并列句	He fished in his pocket and drew out a handful of coins, from which he gave her five gold dollars.
疑问句	Haven't they taught you to say thank you?
陈述句	he said.
陈述句	Thank you, she mumbled.
疑问句	Do you obey the Master?
陈述句	Oh, yes.
并列句	And respect the Scholars?
陈述句	Yes.
陈述句	Lord Asriel's daemon laughed softly.
并列句	It was the first sound she'd made, and Lyra blushed.
并列句	Go and play, then, said Lord Asriel.
并列句	Lyra turned and darted to the door with relief, remembering to turn and blurt out a Goodbye.
并列句	So Lyra's life had been, before the day when she decided to hide in the Retiring Room, and first heard about Dust.
并列句	And of course the Librarian was wrong in saying to the Master that she wouldn't have been interested.
陈述句	She would have listened eagerly now to anyone who could tell her about Dust.
并列句	She was to hear a great deal more about it in the months to come, and eventually she would know more about Dust than anyone in the world; but in the meantime, there was all the rich life of Jordan still being lived around her.
并列句	And in any case there was something else to think about.
并列句	A rumor had been filtering through the streets for some weeks: a rumor that made some people laugh and others grow silent, as some people scoff at ghosts and others fear them.
陈述句	For no reason that anyone could imagine, children were beginning to disappear.
陈述句	* * *  It would happen like this.
并列句	East along the great highway of the River Isis, thronged with slow-moving brick barges and asphalt boats and corn tankers, way down past Henley and Maidenhead to Teddington, where the tide from the German Ocean reaches, and further down still: to Mortlake, past the house of the great magician Dr. Dee; past Falkeshall, where the pleasure gardens spread out bright with fountains and banners by day, with tree lamps and fireworks by night; past White Hall Palace, where the king holds his weekly council of state; past the Shot Tower, dropping its endless drizzle of molten lead into vats of murky water; further down still, to where the river, wide and filthy now, swings in a great curve to the south.
并列句	This is Limehouse, and here is the child who is going to disappear.
陈述句	He is called Tony Makarios.
并列句	His mother thinks he's nine years old, but she has a poor memory that the drink has rotted; he might be eight, or ten.
原因状语从句	His surname is Greek, but like his age, that is a guess on his mother's part, because he looks more Chinese than Greek, and there's Irish and Skraeling and Lascar in him from his mother's side too.
并列句	Tony's not very bright, but he has a sort of clumsy tenderness that sometimes prompts him to give his mother a rough hug and plant a sticky kiss on her cheeks.
并列句	The poor woman is usually too fuddled to start such a procedure herself; but she responds warmly enough, once she realizes what's happening.
陈述句	At the moment Tony is hanging about the market in Pie Street.
陈述句	He's hungry.
并列句	It's early evening, and he won't get fed at home.
并列句	He's got a shilling in his pocket that a soldier gave him for taking a message to his best girl, but Tony's not going to waste that on food, when you can pick up so much for nothing.
并列句	So he wanders through the market, between the old-clothes stalls and the fortune-paper stalls, the fruitmongers and the fried-fish seller, with his little daemon on his shoulder, a sparrow, watching this way and that; and when a stall holder and her daemon are both looking elsewhere, a brisk chirp sounds, and Tony's hand shoots out and returns to his loose shirt with an apple or a couple of nuts, and finally with a hot pie.
并列句	The stall holder sees that, and shouts, and her cat daemon leaps, but Tony's sparrow is aloft and Tony himself halfway down the street already.
并列句	Curses and abuse go with him, but not far.
并列句	He stops running at the steps of St. Catherine's Oratory, where he sits down and takes out his steaming, battered prize, leaving a trail of gravy on his shirt.
并列句	And he's being watched.
陈述句	A lady in a long yellow-red fox-fur coat, a beautiful young lady whose dark hair falls, shining delicately, under the shadow of her fur-lined hood, is standing in the doorway of the oratory, half a dozen steps above him.
并列句	It might be that a service is finishing, for light comes from the doorway behind her, an organ is playing inside, and the lady is holding a jeweled breviary.
陈述句	Tony knows nothing of this.
并列句	His face contentedly deep in the pie, his toes curled inward and his bare soles together, he sits and chews and swallows while his daemon becomes a mouse and grooms her whiskers.
陈述句	The young lady's daemon is moving out from beside the fox-fur coat.
并列句	He is in the form of a monkey, but no ordinary monkey: his fur is long and silky and of the most deep and lustrous gold.
并列句	With sinuous movements he inches down the steps toward the boy, and sits a step above him.
并列句	Then the mouse senses something, and becomes a sparrow again, cocking her head a fraction sideways, and hops along the stone a step or two.
陈述句	The monkey watches the sparrow; the sparrow watches the monkey.
陈述句	The monkey reaches out slowly.
并列句	His little hand is black, his nails perfect horny claws, his movements gentle and inviting.
陈述句	The sparrow can't resist.
并列句	She hops further, and further, and then, with a little flutter, up on to the monkey's hand.
并列句	The monkey lifts her up, and gazes closely at her before standing and swinging back to his human, taking the sparrow daemon with him.
陈述句	The lady bends her scented head to whisper.
并列句	And then Tony turns.
陈述句	He can't help it.
感叹句	Ratter!
陈述句	he says, half in alarm, his mouth full.
陈述句	The sparrow chirps.
陈述句	It must be safe.
并列句	Tony swallows his mouthful and stares.
陈述句	Hello, says the beautiful lady.
疑问句	What's your name?
陈述句	Tony.
疑问句	Where do you live, Tony?
陈述句	Clarice Walk.
疑问句	What's in that pie?
陈述句	Beefsteak.
疑问句	Do you like chocolatl?
感叹句	Yeah!
陈述句	As it happens, I've got more chocolatl than I can drink myself.
并列句	Will you come and help me drink it?
陈述句	He's lost already.
陈述句	He was lost the moment his slow-witted daemon hopped onto the monkey's hand.
并列句	He follows the beautiful young lady and the golden monkey down Denmark Street and along to Hangman's Wharf, and down King George's Steps to a little green door in the side of a tall warehouse.
陈述句	She knocks, the door is opened, they go in, the door is closed.
并列句	Tony will never come out-at least, by that entrance; and he'll never see his mother again.
并列句	She, poor drunken thing, will think he's run away, and when she remembers him, she'll think it was her fault, and sob her sorry heart out.
陈述句	* * *  Little Tony Makarios wasn't the only child to be caught by the lady with the golden monkey.
并列句	He found a dozen others in the cellar of the warehouse, boys and girls, none older than twelve or so; though since all of them had histories like his, none could be sure of their age.
陈述句	What Tony didn't notice, of course, was the factor that they all had in common.
并列句	None of the children in that warm and steamy cellar had reached the age of puberty.
并列句	The kind lady saw him settled on a bench against the wall, and provided by a silent serving woman with a mug of chocolatl from the saucepan on the iron stove.
并列句	Tony ate the rest of his pie and drank the sweet hot liquor without taking much notice of his surroundings, and the surroundings took little notice of him: he was too small to be a threat, and too stolid to promise much satisfaction as a victim.
陈述句	It was another boy who asked the obvious question.
感叹句	Hey, lady!
疑问句	What you got us all here for?
并列句	He was a tough-looking wretch with dark chocolatl on his top lip and a gaunt black rat for a daemon.
并列句	The lady was standing near the door, talking to a stout man with the air of a sea captain, and as she turned to answer, she looked so angelic in the hissing naphtha light that all the children fell silent.
陈述句	We want your help, she said.
疑问句	You don't mind helping us, do you?
陈述句	No one could say a word.
陈述句	They all gazed, suddenly shy.
并列句	They had never seen a lady like this; she was so gracious and sweet and kind that they felt they hardly deserved their good luck, and whatever she asked, they'd give it gladly so as to stay in her presence a little longer.
陈述句	She told them that they were going on a voyage.
并列句	They would be well fed and warmly clothed, and those who wanted to could send messages back to their families to let them know they were safe.
并列句	Captain Magnusson would take them on board his ship very soon, and then when the tide was right, they'd sail out to sea and set a course for the North.
并列句	Soon those few who did want to send a message to what-ever home they had were sitting around the beautiful lady as she wrote a few lines at their dictation and, having let them scratch a clumsy X at the foot of the page, folded it into a scented envelope and wrote the address they told her.
并列句	Tony would have liked to send something to his mother, but he had a realistic idea of her ability to read it.
并列句	He plucked at the lady's fox-fur sleeve and whispered that he'd like her to tell his mum where he was going, and all, and she bent her gracious head close enough to his malodorous little body to hear, and stroked his head and promised to pass the message on.
陈述句	Then the children clustered around to say goodbye.
并列句	The golden monkey stroked all their daemons, and they all touched the fox fur for luck, or as if they were drawing some strength or hope or goodness out of the lady, and she bade them all farewell and saw them in the care of the bold captain on board a steam launch at the jetty.
陈述句	The sky was dark now, the river a mass of bobbing lights.
并列句	The lady stood on the jetty and waved till she could see their faces no more.
并列句	Then she turned back inside, with the golden monkey nestled in her breast, and threw the little bundle of letters into the furnace before leaving the way she had come.
并列句	Children from the slums were easy enough to entice away, but eventually people noticed, and the police were stirred into reluctant action.
陈述句	For a while there were no more bewitchings.
并列句	But a rumor had been born, and little by little it changed and grew and spread, and when after a while a few children disappeared in Norwich, and then Sheffield, and then Manchester, the people in those places who'd heard of the disappearances elsewhere added the new vanishings to the story and gave it new strength.
并列句	And so the legend grew of a mysterious group of enchanters who spirited children away.
并列句	Some said their leader was a beautiful lady, others said a tall man with red eyes, while a third story told of a youth who laughed and sang to his victims so that they followed him like sheep.
陈述句	As for where they took these lost children, no two stories agreed.
陈述句	Some said it was to Hell, under the ground, to Fairyland.
并列句	Others said to a farm where the children were kept and fattened for the table.
并列句	Others said that the children were kept and sold as slaves to rich Tartars....And so on.
并列句	But one thing on which everyone agreed was the name of these invisible kidnappers.
并列句	They had to have a name, or not be referred to at all, and talking about them-especially if you were safe and snug at home, or in Jordan College-was delicious.
并列句	And the name that seemed to settle on them, without anyone's knowing why, was the Gobblers.
并列句	Don't stay out late, or the Gobblers'11 get you!
陈述句	My cousin in Northampton, she knows a woman whose little boy was took by the Gobblers....
陈述句	The Gobblers've been in Stratford.
感叹句	They say they're coming south!
并列句	And, inevitably: Let's play kids and Gobblers!
陈述句	So said Lyra to Roger, one rainy afternoon when they were alone in the dusty attics.
陈述句	He was her devoted slave by this time; he would have followed her to the ends of the earth.
疑问句	How d'you play that?
并列句	You hide and I find you and slice you open, right, like the Gobblers do.
陈述句	You don't know what they do.
陈述句	They might not do that at all.
陈述句	You're afraid of 'em, she said.
陈述句	I can tell.
陈述句	I en't.
陈述句	I don't believe in 'em anyway.
陈述句	I do, she said decisively.
并列句	But I en't afraid either.
陈述句	I'd just do what my uncle done last time he came to Jordan.
陈述句	I seen him.
并列句	He was in the Retiring Room and there was this guest who weren't polite, and my uncle just give him a hard look and the man fell dead on the spot, with all foam and froth round his mouth.
陈述句	He never, said Roger doubtfully.
陈述句	They never said anything about that in the kitchen.
陈述句	Anyway, you en't allowed in the Retiring Room.
陈述句	'Course not.
陈述句	They wouldn't tell servants about a thing like that.
并列句	And I have been in the Retiring Room, so there.
陈述句	Anyway, my uncle's always doing that.
陈述句	He done it to some Tartars when they caught him once.
并列句	They tied him up and they was going to cut his guts out, but when the first man come up with the knife, my uncle just looked at him, and he fell dead, so another one come up and he done the same to him, and finally there was only one left.
并列句	My uncle said he'd leave him alive if he untied him, so he did, and then my uncle killed him anyway just to teach him a lesson.
并列句	Roger was less sure about that than about Gobblers, but the story was too good to waste, so they took it in turns to be Lord Asriel and the expiring Tartars, using sherbet dip for the foam.
并列句	However, that was a distraction; Lyra was still intent on playing Gobblers, and she inveigled Roger down into the wine cellars, which they entered by means of the Butler's spare set of keys.
并列句	Together they crept through the great vaults where the College's Tokay and Canary, its Burgundy, its brantwijn were lying under the cobwebs of ages.
并列句	Ancient stone arches rose above them supported by pillars as thick as ten trees, irregular flagstones lay underfoot, and on all sides were ranged rack upon rack, tier upon tier, of bottles and barrels.
陈述句	It was fascinating.
疑问句	With Gobblers forgotten again, the two children tiptoed from end to end holding a candle in trembling fingers, peering into every dark corner, with a single question growing more urgent in Lyra's mind every moment: what did the wine taste like?
陈述句	There was an easy way of answering that.
并列句	Lyra-over Roger's fervent protests-picked out the oldest, twistiest, greenest bottle she could find, and, not having anything to extract the cork with, broke it off at the neck.
并列句	Huddled in the furthest corner, they sipped at the heady crimson liquor, wondering when they'd become drunk, and how they'd tell when they were.
并列句	Lyra didn't like the taste much, but she had to admit how grand and complicated it was.
并列句	The funniest thing was watching their two daemons, who seemed to be getting more and more muddled: falling over, giggling senselessly, and changing shape to look like gargoyles, each trying to be uglier than the other.
并列句	Finally, and almost simultaneously, the children discovered what it was like to be drunk.
疑问句	Do they like doing this?
陈述句	gasped Roger, after vomiting copiously.
陈述句	Yes, said Lyra, in the same condition.
并列句	And so do I, she added stubbornly.
陈述句	Lyra learned nothing from that episode except that playing Gobblers led to interesting places.
并列句	She remembered her uncle's words in their last interview, and began to explore underground, for what was above ground was only a small fraction of the whole.
并列句	Like some enormous fungus whose root system extended over acres, Jordan (finding itself jostling for space above ground with St. Michael's College on one side, Gabriel College on the other, and the University Library behind) had begun, sometime in the Middle Ages, to spread below the surface.
并列句	Tunnels, shafts, vaults, cellars, staircases had so hollowed out the earth below Jordan and for several hundred yards around it that there was almost as much air below ground as above; Jordan College stood on a sort of froth of stone.
并列句	And now that Lyra had the taste for exploring it, she abandoned her usual haunt, the irregular alps of the College roofs, and plunged with Roger into this netherworld.
疑问句	From playing at Gobblers she had turned to hunting them, for what could be more likely than that they were lurking out of sight below the ground?
并列句	So one day she and Roger made their way into the crypt below the oratory.
陈述句	This was where generations of Masters had been buried, each in his lead-lined oak coffin in niches along the stone walls.
疑问句	A stone tablet below each space gave their names:  SIMON LE CLERC, MASTER 1765-1789 CEREBATON  REQUIESCANT IN PACE   What's that mean?
陈述句	said Roger.
并列句	The first part's his name, and the last bit's Roman.
并列句	And there's the dates in the middle when he was Master.
并列句	And the other name must be his daemon.
陈述句	They moved along the silent vault, tracing the letters of more inscriptions:  FRANCIS LYALL, MASTER 1748-1765   ZOHARIEL REQUIESCANT IN PACE  ICNATIUS COLE, MASTER 1745-1748  MUSCA REQUIESCANT IN PACE  On each coffin, Lyra was interested to see, a brass plaque bore a picture of a different being: this one a basilisk, this a serpent, this a monkey.
陈述句	She realized that they were images of the dead men's daemons.
并列句	As people became adult, their daemons lost the power to change and assumed one shape, keeping it permanently.
感叹句	These coffins' ve got skeletons in em!
陈述句	whispered Roger.
陈述句	Moldering flesh, whispered Lyra.
并列句	And worms and maggots all twisting about in their eye sockets.
陈述句	Must be ghosts down here, said Roger, shivering pleasantly.
陈述句	Beyond the first crypt they found a passage lined with stone shelves.
并列句	Each shelf was partitioned off into square sections, and in each section rested a skull.
并列句	Roger's daemon, tail tucked firmly between her legs, shivered against him and gave a little quiet howl.
陈述句	Hush, he said.
并列句	Lyra couldn't see Pantalaimon, but she knew his moth form was resting on her shoulder and probably shivering too.
并列句	She reached up and lifted the nearest skull gently out of its resting place.
疑问句	What you doing?
陈述句	said Roger.
陈述句	You en't supposed to touch em.
并列句	She turned it over and over, taking no notice.
并列句	Something suddenly fell out of the hole at the base of the skull - fell through her fingers and rang as it hit the floor, and she nearly dropped the skull in alarm.
感叹句	It's a coin!
陈述句	said Roger, feeling for it.
感叹句	Might be treasure!
并列句	He held it up to the candle and they both gazed wide-eyed.
并列句	It was not a coin, but a little disc of bronze with a crudely engraved inscription showing a cat.
陈述句	It's like the ones on the coffins, said Lyra.
陈述句	It's his daemon.
陈述句	Must be.
并列句	Better put it back, said Roger uneasily, and Lyra upturned the skull and dropped the disk back into its immemorial resting place before returning the skull to the shelf.
陈述句	Each of the other skulls, they found, had its own daemon-coin, showing its owner's lifetime companion still close to him in death.
疑问句	Who d'you think these were when they were alive?
陈述句	said Lyra.
陈述句	Probably Scholars, I reckon.
陈述句	Only the Masters get coffins.
并列句	There's probably been so many Scholars all down the centuries that there wouldn't be room to bury the whole of 'em, so they just cut their heads off and keep them.
陈述句	That's the most important part of 'em anyway.
并列句	They found no Gobblers, but the catacombs under the oratory kept Lyra and Roger busy for days.
陈述句	Once she tried to play a trick on some of the dead Scholars, by switching around the coins in their skulls so they were with the wrong daemons.
并列句	Pantalaimon became so agitated at this that he changed into a bat and flew up and down uttering shrill cries and flapping his wings in her face, but she took no notice: it was too good a joke to waste.
让步状语从句	She paid for it later, though.
并列句	In bed in her narrow room at the top of Staircase Twelve she was visited by a night-ghast, and woke up screaming at the three robed figures who stood at the bedside pointing their bony fingers before throwing back their cowls to show bleeding stumps where their heads should have been.
并列句	Only when Pantalaimon became a lion and roared at them did they retreat, backing away into the substance of the wall until all that was visible was their arms, then their horny yellow-gray hands, then their twitching fingers, then nothing.
并列句	First thing in the morning she hastened down to the catacombs and restored the daemon-coins to their rightful places, and whispered Sorry!
感叹句	Sorry!
陈述句	to the skulls.
并列句	The catacombs were much larger than the wine cellars, but they too had a limit.
并列句	When Lyra and Roger had explored every corner of them and were sure there were no Gobblers to be found there, they turned their attention elsewhere-but not before they were spotted leaving the crypt by the Intercessor, who called them back into the oratory.
陈述句	The Intercessor was a plump, elderly man known as Father Heyst.
并列句	It was his job to lead all the College services, to preach and pray and hear confessions.
并列句	When Lyra was younger, he had taken an interest in her spiritual welfare, only to be confounded by her sly indifference and insincere repentances.
陈述句	She was not spiritually promising, he had decided.
并列句	When they heard him call, Lyra and Roger turned reluctantly and walked, dragging their feet, into the great musty-smelling dimness of the oratory.
并列句	Candles flickered here and there in front of images of the saints; a faint and distant clatter came from the organ loft, where some repairs were going on; a servant was polishing the brass lectern.
陈述句	Father Heyst beckoned from the vestry door.
疑问句	Where have you been?
陈述句	he said to them.
并列句	I've seen you come in here two or three times now.
疑问句	What are you up to?
陈述句	His tone was not accusatory.
条件状语从句	He sounded as if he were genuinely interested.
陈述句	His daemon flicked a lizard tongue at them from her perch on his shoulder.
陈述句	Lyra said, We wanted to look down in the crypt.
疑问句	Whatever for?
陈述句	The...the coffins.
陈述句	We wanted to see all the coffins, she said.
并列句	But why?
陈述句	She shrugged.
陈述句	It was her constant response when she was pressed.
并列句	And you, he went on, turning to Roger.
陈述句	Roger's daemon anxiously wagged her terrier tail to propitiate him.
疑问句	What's your name?
陈述句	Roger, Father.
条件状语从句	If you're a servant, where do you work?
陈述句	In the kitchen, Father.
疑问句	Should you be there now?
陈述句	Yes, Father.
陈述句	Then be off with you.
并列句	Roger turned and ran.
陈述句	Lyra dragged her foot from side to side on the floor.
陈述句	As for you, Lyra, said Father Heyst, I'm pleased to see you taking an interest in what lies in the oratory.
陈述句	You are a lucky child, to have all this history around you.
陈述句	Mm, said Lyra.
并列句	But I wonder about your choice of companions.
疑问句	Are you a lonely child?
陈述句	No, she said.
疑问句	Do you...do you miss the society of other children?
陈述句	No.
陈述句	I don't mean Roger the kitchen boy.
陈述句	I mean children such as yourself.
陈述句	Nobly born children.
疑问句	Would you like to have some companions of that sort?
陈述句	No.
并列句	But other girls, perhaps... No.
并列句	You see, none of us would want you to miss all the usual childhood pleasures and pastimes.
陈述句	I sometimes think it must be a lonely life for you here among a company of elderly Scholars, Lyra.
疑问句	Do you feel that?
陈述句	No.
陈述句	He tapped his thumbs together over his interlaced fingers, unable to think of anything else to ask this stubborn child.
并列句	If there is anything troubling you, he said finally, you know you can come and tell me about it.
陈述句	I hope you feel you can always do that.
陈述句	Yes, she said.
疑问句	Do you say your prayers?
陈述句	Yes.
陈述句	Good girl.
陈述句	Well, run along.
并列句	With a barely concealed sigh of relief, she turned and left.
陈述句	Having failed to find Gobblers below ground, Lyra took to the streets again.
陈述句	She was at home there.
陈述句	Then, almost when she'd lost interest in them, the Gobblers appeared in Oxford.
陈述句	The first Lyra heard of it was when a young boy went missing from a gyptian family she knew.
并列句	It was about the time of the horse fair, and the canal basin was crowded with narrowboats and butty boats, with traders and travelers, and the wharves along the waterfront in Jericho were bright with gleaming harness and loud with the clop of hooves and the clamor of bargaining.
陈述句	Lyra always enjoyed the horse fair; as well as the chance of stealing a ride on a less-than-well-attended horse, there were endless opportunities for provoking warfare.
并列句	And this year she had a grand plan.
陈述句	Inspired by the capture of the narrowboat the year before, she intended this time to make a proper voyage before being turned out.
并列句	If she and her cronies from the College kitchens could get as far as Abingdon, they could play havoc with the weir....
并列句	But this year there was to be no war.
陈述句	Something else happened.
并列句	Lyra was sauntering along the edge of the Port Meadow boatyard in the morning sun, without Roger for once (he had been detailed to wash the buttery floor) but with Hugh Lovat and Simon Parslow, passing a stolen cigarette from one to another and blowing out the smoke ostentatiously, when she heard a cry in a voice she recognized.
疑问句	Well, what have you done with him, you half-arsed pillock?
并列句	It was a mighty voice, a woman's voice, but a woman with lungs of brass and leather.
原因状语从句	Lyra looked around for her at once, because this was Ma Costa, who had clouted Lyra dizzy on two occasions but given her hot gingerbread on three, and whose family was noted for the grandeur and sumptu-ousness of their boat.
并列句	They were princes among gyptians, and Lyra admired Ma Costa greatly, but she intended to be wary of her for some time yet, for theirs was the boat she had hijacked.
并列句	One of Lyra's brat companions picked up a stone automatically when he heard the commotion, but Lyra said, Put it down.
陈述句	She's in a temper.
陈述句	She could snap your backbone like a twig.
陈述句	In fact, Ma Costa looked more anxious than angry.
并列句	The man she was addressing, a horse trader, was shrugging and spreading his hands.
陈述句	Well, I dunno, he was saying.
并列句	He was here one minute and gone the next.
陈述句	I never saw where he went....
感叹句	He was helping you!
感叹句	He was holding your bloody horses for you!
疑问句	Well, he should've stayed there, shouldn't he?
原因状语从句	Runs off in the middle of a job- He got no further, because Ma Costa suddenly dealt him a mighty blow on the side of the head, and followed it up with such a volley of curses and slaps that he yelled and turned to flee.
并列句	The other horse traders nearby jeered, and a flighty colt reared up in alarm.
疑问句	What's going on?
陈述句	said Lyra to a gyptian child who'd been watching open-mouthed.
疑问句	What's she angry about?
陈述句	It's her kid, said the child.
陈述句	It's Billy.
陈述句	She probly reckons the Gobblers got him.
陈述句	They might've done, too.
疑问句	I ain't seen him meself since- The Gobblers?
疑问句	Has they come to Oxford, then?
陈述句	The gyptian boy turned away to call to his friends, who were all watching Ma Costa.
感叹句	She don't know what's going on!
感叹句	She don't know the Gobblers is here!
并列句	Half a dozen brats turned with expressions of derision, and Lyra threw her cigarette down, recognizing the cue for a fight.
并列句	Everyone's daemon instantly became warlike: each child was accompanied by fangs, or claws, or bristling fur, and Pantalaimon, contemptuous of the limited imaginations of these gyptian daemons, became a dragon the size of a deer hound.
并列句	But before they could all join battle, Ma Costa herself waded in, smacking two of the gyptians aside and confronting Lyra like a prizefighter.
疑问句	You seen him?
陈述句	she demanded of Lyra.
疑问句	You seen Billy?
陈述句	No, Lyra said.
陈述句	We just got here.
陈述句	I en't seen Billy for months.
并列句	Ma Costa's daemon was wheeling in the bright air above her head, a hawk, fierce yellow eyes snapping this way and that, unblinking.
陈述句	Lyra was frightened.
并列句	No one worried about a child gone missing for a few hours, certainly not a gyptian: in the tight-knit gyptian boat world, all children were precious and extravagantly loved, and a mother knew that if a child was out of sight, it wouldn't be far from someone else's who would protect it instinctively.
并列句	But here was Ma Costa, a queen among the gyptians, in a terror for a missing child.
疑问句	What was going on?
并列句	Ma Costa looked half-blindly over the little group of children and turned away to stumble through the crowd on the wharf, bellowing for her child.
陈述句	At once the children turned back to one another, their feud abandoned in the face of her grief.
疑问句	What is them Gobblers?
陈述句	said Simon Parslow, one of Lyra's companions.
陈述句	The first gyptian boy said, You know.
陈述句	They been stealing kids all over the country.
陈述句	They're pirates- They en't pirates, corrected another gyptian.
陈述句	They're cannaboles.
陈述句	That's why they call 'em Gobblers.
疑问句	They eat kids?
陈述句	said Lyra's other crony, Hugh Lovat, a kitchen boy from St. Michael's.
陈述句	No one knows, said the first gyptian.
并列句	They take 'em away and they en't never seen again.
陈述句	We all know that, said Lyra.
并列句	We been playing kids and Gobblers for months, before you were, I bet.
并列句	But 1 bet no one's seen 'em.
陈述句	They have, said one boy.
疑问句	Who, then?
陈述句	persisted Lyra.
疑问句	Have you seen 'em?
疑问句	How d'you know it en't just one person?
陈述句	Charlie seen 'em in Banbury, said a gyptian girl.
并列句	They come and talked to this lady while another man took her little boy out the garden.
陈述句	Yeah, piped up Charlie, a gyptian boy.
感叹句	I seen 'em do it!
疑问句	What did they look like?
陈述句	said Lyra.
陈述句	Well...l  never  properly  saw  'em,  Charlie  said.
让步状语从句	I saw their truck, though, he added.
陈述句	They come in a white truck.
并列句	They put the little boy in the truck and drove off quick.
并列句	But why do they call 'em Gobblers?
陈述句	Lyra asked.
陈述句	'Cause they eat 'em, said the first gyptian boy.
陈述句	Someone told us in Northampton.
并列句	They been up there and all.
并列句	This girl in Northampton, her brother was took, and she said the men as took him told her they was going to eat him.
陈述句	Everyone knows that.
陈述句	They gobble 'em up.
陈述句	A gyptian girl standing nearby began to cry loudly.
陈述句	That's Billy's cousin, said Charlie.
疑问句	Lyra said, Who saw Billy last?
陈述句	Me, said half a dozen voices.
陈述句	I seen him holding Johnny Fiorelli's old horse-I seen him by the toffee-apple seller-I seen him swinging on the crane- When Lyra had sorted it out, she gathered that Billy had been seen for certain not less than two hours previously.
陈述句	So, she said, sometime in the last two hours there must've been Gobblers here....
并列句	They all looked around, shivering in spite of the warm sun, the crowded wharf, the familiar smells of tar and horses and smokeleaf.
原因状语从句	The trouble was that because no one knew what these Gobblers looked like, anyone might be a Gobbler, as Lyra pointed out to the appalled gang, who were now all under her sway, collegers and gyptians alike.
陈述句	They're bound to look like ordinary people, else they'd be seen at once, she explained.
条件状语从句	If they only came at night, they could look like anything.
并列句	But if they come in the daylight, they got to look ordinary.
陈述句	So any of these people might be Gobblers....
陈述句	They en't, said a gyptian uncertainly.
陈述句	I know 'em all.
并列句	All right, not these, but anyone else, said Lyra.
并列句	Let's go and look for 'em!
并列句	And their white truck!
并列句	And that precipitated a swarm.
并列句	Other searchers soon joined the first ones, and before long, thirty or more gyptian children were racing from end to end of the wharves, running in and out of stables, scrambling over the cranes and derricks in the boatyard, leaping over the fence into the wide meadow, swinging fifteen at a time on the old swing bridge over the green water, and running full pelt through the narrow streets of Jericho, between the little brick terraced houses and into the great square-towered oratory of St. Barnabas the Chymist.
并列句	Half of them didn't know what they were looking for, and thought it was just a lark, but those closest to Lyra felt a real fear and apprehension every time they glimpsed a solitary figure down an alley or in the dimness of the oratory: was it a Gobbler?
并列句	But of course it wasn't.
并列句	Eventually, with no success, and with the shadow of Billy's real disappearance hanging over them all, the fun faded away.
并列句	As Lyra and the two College boys left Jericho when suppertime neared, they saw the gyptians gathering on the wharf next to where the Costas' boat was moored.
并列句	Some of the women were crying loudly, and the men were standing in angry groups, with all their daemons agitated and rising in nervous flight or snarling at shadows.
陈述句	I bet them Gobblers wouldn't dare come in here, said Lyra to Simon Parslow, as the two of them stepped over the threshold into the great lodge of Jordan.
陈述句	No, he said uncertainly.
并列句	But I know there's a kid missing from the market.
疑问句	Who?
陈述句	Lyra said.
并列句	She knew most of the market children, but she hadn't heard of this.
陈述句	Jessie Reynolds, out the saddler's.
并列句	She weren't there at shutting-up time yesterday, and she'd only gone for a bit of fish for her dad's tea.
并列句	She never come back and no one'd seen her.
并列句	They searched all through the market and everywhere.
感叹句	I never heard about that!
陈述句	said Lyra, indignant.
并列句	She considered it a deplorable lapse on the part of her subjects not to tell her everything and at once.
陈述句	Well, it was only yesterday.
陈述句	She might've turned up now.
并列句	I'm going to ask, said Lyra, and turned to leave the lodge.
并列句	But she hadn't got out of the gate before the Porter called her.
感叹句	Here, Lyra!
陈述句	You're not to go out again this evening.
陈述句	Master's orders.
疑问句	Why not?
陈述句	I told you, Master's orders.
条件状语从句	He says if you come in, you stay in.
并列句	You catch me, she said, and darted out before the old man could leave his doorway.
并列句	She ran across the narrow street and down into the alley where the vans unloaded goods for the covered market.
并列句	This being shutting-up time, there were few vans there now, but a knot of youths stood smoking and talking by the central gate opposite the high stone wall of St. Michael's College.
原因状语从句	Lyra knew one of them, a sixteen-year-old she admired because he could spit further than anyone else she'd ever heard of, and she went and waited humbly for him to notice her.
疑问句	Yeah?
疑问句	What do you want?
陈述句	he said finally.
疑问句	Is Jessie Reynolds disappeared?
陈述句	Yeah.
疑问句	Why?
并列句	'Cause a gyptian kid disappeared today and all.
陈述句	They're always disappearing, gyptians.
陈述句	After every horse fair they disappear.
陈述句	So do horses, said one of his friends.
陈述句	This is different, said Lyra.
陈述句	This is a kid.
并列句	We was looking for him all afternoon and the other kids said the Gobblers got him.
疑问句	The what?
陈述句	The Gobblers, she said.
疑问句	En't you heard of the Gobblers?
并列句	It was news to the other boys as well, and apart from a few coarse comments they listened closely to what she told them.
陈述句	Gobblers, said Lyra's acquaintance, whose name was Dick.
陈述句	It's stupid.
陈述句	These gyptians, they pick up all kinds of stupid ideas.
并列句	They said there was Gobblers in Banbury a couple of weeks ago, Lyra insisted, and there was five kids taken.
陈述句	They probably come to Oxford now to get kids from us.
陈述句	It must've been them what got Jessie.
陈述句	There was a kid lost over Cowley way, said one of the other boys.
陈述句	I remember now.
并列句	My auntie, she was there yesterday, 'cause she sells fish and chips out a van, and she heard about it....Some little boy, that's it...I dunno about the Gobblers, though.
陈述句	They en't real, Gobblers.
陈述句	Just a story.
感叹句	They are!
陈述句	Lyra said.
陈述句	The gyptians seen 'em.
原因状语从句	They reckon they eat the kids they catch, and... She stopped in midsentence, because something had suddenly come into her mind.
并列句	During that strange evening she'd spent hidden in the Retiring Room, Lord Asriel had shown a lantern slide of a man with streams of light pouring from his hand; and there'd been a small figure beside him, with less light around it; and he'd said it was a child; and someone had asked if it was a severed child, and her uncle had said no, that was the point.
陈述句	Lyra remembered that severed meant cut.
并列句	And then something else hit her heart: where was Roger?
陈述句	She hadn't seen him since the morning....
陈述句	Suddenly she felt afraid.
并列句	Pantalaimon, as a miniature lion, sprang into her arms and growled.
并列句	She said goodbye to the youths by the gate and walked quietly back into Turl Street, and then ran full pelt for Jordan lodge, tumbling in through the door a second before the now cheetah-shaped daemon.
陈述句	The Porter was sanctimonious.
并列句	I had to ring the Master and tell him, he said.
陈述句	He en't pleased at all.
陈述句	I wouldn't be in your shoes, not for money I wouldn't.
疑问句	Where's Roger?
陈述句	she demanded.
陈述句	I en't seen him.
陈述句	He'll be for it, too.
并列句	Ooh, when Mr. Cawson catches him- Lyra ran to the kitchen and thrust her way into the hot, clangorous, steaming bustle.
疑问句	Where's Roger?
陈述句	she shouted.
感叹句	Clear off, Lyra!
感叹句	We're busy here!
并列句	But where is he?
并列句	Has he turned up or not?
陈述句	No one seemed interested.
并列句	But where is he?
感叹句	You must've heard!
并列句	Lyra shouted at the chef, who boxed her ears and sent her storming away.
并列句	Bernie the pastry cook tried to calm her down, but she wouldn't be consoled.
感叹句	They got him!
并列句	Them bloody Gobblers, they oughter catch 'em and bloody kill 'em!
感叹句	I hate 'em!
并列句	You don't care about Roger- Lyra, we all care about Roger- You don't, else you'd all stop work and go and look for him right now!
感叹句	I hate you!
陈述句	There could be a dozen reasons why Roger en't turned up.
陈述句	Listen to sense.
并列句	We got dinner to prepare and serve in less than an hour; the Master's got guests in the lodging, and he'll be eating over there, and that means Chef'11 have to attend to getting the food there quick so it don't go cold; and what with one thing and another, Lyra, life's got to go on.
并列句	I'm sure Roger'11 turn up.... Lyra turned and ran out of the kitchen, knocking over a stack of silver dish covers and ignoring the roar of anger that arose.
并列句	She sped down the steps and across the quadrangle, between the chapel and Palmer's Tower and into the Yaxley Quad, where the oldest buildings of the College stood.
陈述句	Pantalaimon scampered before her, flowing up the stairs to the very top, where Lyra's bedroom was.
并列句	Lyra barged open the door, dragged her rickety chair to the window, flung wide the casement, and scrambled out.
并列句	There was a lead-lined stone gutter a foot wide just below the window, and once she was standing in that, she turned and clambered up over the rough tiles until she stood on the topmost ridge of the roof.
并列句	There she opened her mouth and screamed.
并列句	Pantalaimon, who always became a bird once on the roof, flew round and round shrieking rook shrieks with her.
陈述句	The evening sky was awash with peach, apricot, cream: tender little ice-cream clouds in a wide orange sky.
并列句	The spires and towers of Oxford stood around them, level but no higher; the green woods of Chateau-Vert and White Ham rose on either side to the east and the west.
并列句	Rooks were cawing somewhere, and bells were ringing, and from the oxpens the steady beat of a gas engine announced the ascent of the evening Royal Mail zeppelin for London.
并列句	Lyra watched it climb away beyond the spire of St. Michael's Chapel, as big at first as the tip of her little finger when she held it at arm's length, and then steadily smaller until it was a dot in the pearly sky.
并列句	She turned and looked down into the shadowed quadrangle, where the black-gowned figures of the Scholars were already beginning to drift in ones and twos toward the buttery, their daemons strutting or fluttering alongside or perching calmly on their shoulders.
陈述句	The lights were going on in the Hall; she could see the stained-glass windows gradually beginning to glow as a servant moved up the tables lighting the naphtha lamps.
陈述句	The Steward's bell began to toll, announcing half an hour before dinner.
陈述句	This was her world.
并列句	She wanted it to stay the same forever and ever, but it was changing around her, for someone out there was stealing children.
陈述句	She sat on the roof ridge, chin in hands.
陈述句	We better rescue him, Pantalaimon, she said.
陈述句	He answered in his rook voice from the chimney.
陈述句	It'll be dangerous, he said.
感叹句	'Course!
陈述句	I know that.
陈述句	Remember what they said in the Retiring Room.
疑问句	What?
陈述句	Something about a child up in the Arctic.
陈述句	The one that wasn't attracting the Dust.
疑问句	They said it was an entire child....What about it?
并列句	That might be what they're going to do to Roger and the gyptians and the other kids.
疑问句	What?
疑问句	Well, what does entire mean?
陈述句	Dunno.
陈述句	They cut 'em in half, probably.
陈述句	I reckon they make slaves out of 'em.
陈述句	That'd be more use.
陈述句	They probably got mines up there.
陈述句	Uranium mines for atomcraft.
陈述句	I bet that's what it is.
原因状语从句	And if they sent grownups down the mine, they'd be dead, so they use kids instead because they cost less.
陈述句	That's what they've done with him.
原因状语从句	I think- But what Pantalaimon thought had to wait, because someone began to shout from below.
感叹句	Lyra!
感叹句	Lyra!
感叹句	You come in this instant!
陈述句	There was a banging on the window frame.
并列句	Lyra knew the voice and the impatience: it was Mrs. Lonsdale, the Housekeeper.
陈述句	There was no hiding from her.
并列句	Tight-faced, Lyra slid down the roof and into the gutter, and then climbed in through the window again.
并列句	Mrs. Lonsdale was running some water into the little chipped basin, to the accompaniment of a great groaning and hammering from the pipes.
感叹句	The number of times you been told about going out there-Look at you!
感叹句	Just look at your skirt-it's filthy!
并列句	Take it off at once and wash yourself while I look for something decent that en't torn.
并列句	Why you can't keep yourself clean and tidy... Lyra was too sulky even to ask why she was having to wash and dress, and no grownup ever gave reasons of their own accord.
并列句	She dragged the dress over her head and dropped it on the narrow bed, and began to wash desultorily while Pantalaimon, a canary now, hopped closer and closer to Mrs. Lonsdale's daemon, a stolid retriever, trying in vain to annoy him.
感叹句	Look at the state of this wardrobe!
感叹句	You en't hung nothing up for weeks!
陈述句	Look at the creases in this- Look at this, look at that...Lyra didn't want to look.
陈述句	She shut her eyes as she rubbed at her face with the thin towel.
陈述句	You'll just have to wear it as it is.
陈述句	There en't time to take an iron to it.
陈述句	God bless me, girl, your knees-look at the state of them.... Don't want to look at nothing, Lyra muttered.
陈述句	Mrs. Lonsdale smacked her leg.
陈述句	Wash, she said ferociously.
陈述句	You get all that dirt off.
疑问句	Why?
陈述句	Lyra said at last.
陈述句	I never wash my knees usually.
陈述句	No one's going to look at my knees.
疑问句	What've I got to do all this for?
陈述句	You don't care about Roger neither, any more than Chef does.
陈述句	I'm the only one that- Another smack, on the other leg.
陈述句	None of that nonsense.
陈述句	I'm a Parslow, same as Roger's father.
陈述句	He's my second cousin.
陈述句	I bet you didn't know that, 'cause I bet you never asked, Miss Lyra.
陈述句	I bet it never occurred to you.
陈述句	Don't you chide me with not caring about the boy.
并列句	God knows, I even care about you, and you give me little enough reason and no thanks.
并列句	She seized the flannel and rubbed Lyra's knees so hard she left the skin bright pink and sore, but clean.
并列句	The reason for this is you're going to have dinner with the Master and his guests.
陈述句	I hope to God you behave.
并列句	Speak when you're spoken to, be quiet and polite, smile nicely and don't you ever say Dunno when someone asks you a question.
并列句	She dragged the best dress onto Lyra's skinny frame, tugged it straight, fished a bit of red ribbon out of the tangle in a drawer, and brushed Lyra's hair with a coarse brush.
条件状语从句	If they'd let me know earlier, I could've given your hair a proper wash. Well, that's too bad.
陈述句	As long as they don't look too close...There.
陈述句	Now stand up straight.
疑问句	Where's those best patent-leather shoes?
并列句	Five minutes later Lyra was knocking on the door of the Master's lodging, the grand and slightly gloomy house that opened into the Yaxley Quadrangle and backed onto the Library Garden.
陈述句	Pantalaimon, an ermine now for politeness, rubbed himself against her leg.
并列句	The door was opened by the Master's manservant Cousins, an old enemy of Lyra's; but both knew that this was a state of truce.
陈述句	Mrs. Lonsdale said I was to come, said Lyra.
陈述句	Yes, said Cousins, stepping aside.
陈述句	The Master's in the drawing room.
陈述句	He showed her into the large room that overlooked the Library Garden.
并列句	The last of the sun shone into it, through the gap between the library and Palmer's Tower, and lit up the heavy pictures and the glum silver the Master collected.
并列句	It also lit up the guests, and Lyra realized why they weren't going to dine in Hall: three of the guests were women.
陈述句	Ah, Lyra, said the Master.
陈述句	I'm so glad you could come.
疑问句	Cousins, could you find some sort of soft drink?
陈述句	Dame Hannah, I don't think you've met Lyra...Lord Asriel's niece, you know.
陈述句	Dame Hannah Relf was the head of one of the women's colleges, an elderly gray-haired lady whose daemon was a marmoset.
并列句	Lyra shook hands as politely as she could, and was then introduced to the other guests, who were, like Dame Hannah, Scholars from other colleges and quite uninteresting.
陈述句	Then the Master came to the final guest.
陈述句	Mrs. Coulter, he said, this is our Lyra.
并列句	Lyra, come and say hello to Mrs. Coulter.
陈述句	Hello, Lyra, said Mrs. Coulter.
并列句	She was beautiful and young.
并列句	Her sleek black hair framed her cheeks, and her daemon was a golden monkey.
陈述句	FOUR  THE ALETHIOMETER    I hope you'll sit next to me at dinner, said Mrs. Coulter, making room for Lyra on the sofa.
陈述句	I'm not used to the grandeur of a Master's lodging.
并列句	You'll have to show me which knife and fork to use.
疑问句	Are you a female Scholar?
陈述句	said Lyra.
并列句	She regarded female Scholars with a proper Jordan disdain: there were such people, but, poor things, they could never be taken more seriously than animals dressed up and acting a play.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter, on the other hand, was not like any female Scholar Lyra had seen, and certainly not like the two serious elderly ladies who were the other female guests.
陈述句	Lyra had asked the question expecting the answer No, in fact, for Mrs. Coulter had such an air of glamour that Lyra was entranced.
陈述句	She could hardly take her eyes off her.
陈述句	Not really, Mrs. Coulter said.
并列句	I'm a member of Dame Hannah's college, but most of my work takes place outside Oxford....Tell me about yourself, Lyra.
疑问句	Have you always lived at Jordan College?
并列句	Within five minutes Lyra had told her everything about her half-wild life: her favorite routes over the rooftops, the battle of the claybeds, the time she and Roger had caught and roasted a rook, her intention to capture a narrowboat from the gyptians and sail it to Abingdon, and so on.
并列句	She even (looking around and lowering her voice) told her about the trick she and Roger had played on the skulls in the crypt.
并列句	And these ghosts came, right, they came to my bedroom without their heads!
并列句	They couldn't talk except for making sort of gurgling noises, but I knew what they wanted all right.
并列句	So I went down next day and put their coins back.
陈述句	They'd probably have killed me else.
疑问句	You're not afraid of danger, then?
陈述句	said Mrs. Coulter admiringly.
并列句	They were at dinner by this time, and as Lyra had hoped, sitting next to each other.
并列句	Lyra ignored completely the Librarian on her other side and spent the whole meal talking to Mrs. Coulter.
疑问句	When the ladies withdrew for coffee, Dame Hannah said, Tell me, Lyra-are they going to send you to school?
陈述句	Lyra looked blank.
陈述句	I dun-I don't know, she said.
陈述句	Probably not, she added for safety.
陈述句	I wouldn't want to put them to any trouble, she went on piously.
并列句	Or expense.
并列句	It's probably better if I just go on living at Jordan and getting educated by the Scholars here when they've got a bit of spare time.
陈述句	Being as they're here already, they're probably free.
并列句	And does your uncle Lord Asriel have any plans for you?
陈述句	said the other lady, who was a Scholar at the other women's college.
陈述句	Yes, said Lyra.
陈述句	I expect so.
让步状语从句	Not school, though.
陈述句	He's going to take me to the North next time he goes.
陈述句	I remember him telling me, said Mrs. Coulter.
陈述句	Lyra blinked.
并列句	The two female Scholars sat up very slightly, though their demons, either well behaved or torpid, did no more than flick their eyes at each other.
陈述句	I met him at the Royal Arctic Institute, Mrs. Coulter went on.
原因状语从句	As a matter of fact, it's partly because of that meeting that I'm here today.
疑问句	Are you an explorer too?
陈述句	said Lyra.
陈述句	In a kind of way.
陈述句	I've been to the North several times.
陈述句	Last year I spent three months in Greenland making observations of the Aurora.
并列句	That was it; nothing and no one else existed now for Lyra.
并列句	She gazed at Mrs. Coulter with awe, and listened rapt and silent to her tales of igloo building, of seal hunting, of negotiating with the Lapland witches.
并列句	The two female Scholars had nothing so exciting to tell, and sat in silence until the men came in.
陈述句	Later, when the guests were preparing to leave, the Master said, Stay behind, Lyra.
并列句	I'd like to talk to you for a minute or two.
并列句	Go to my study, child; sit down there and wait for me.
陈述句	Puzzled, tired, exhilarated, Lyra did as he told her.
并列句	Cousins the manservant showed her in, and pointedly left the door open so that he could see what she was up to from the hall, where he was helping people on with their coats.
并列句	Lyra watched for Mrs. Coulter, but she didn't see her, and then the Master came into the study and shut the door.
陈述句	He sat down heavily in the armchair by the fireplace.
并列句	His daemon flapped up to the chair back and sat by his head, her old hooded eyes on Lyra.
陈述句	The lamp hissed gently as the Master said: So, Lyra.
陈述句	You've been talking to Mrs. Coulter.
疑问句	Did you enjoy hearing what she said?
感叹句	Yes!
陈述句	She is a remarkable lady.
陈述句	She's wonderful.
陈述句	She's the most wonderful person I've ever met.
陈述句	The Master sighed.
并列句	In his black suit and black tie he looked as much like his daemon as anyone could, and suddenly Lyra thought that one day, quite soon, he would be buried in the crypt under the oratory, and an artist would engrave a picture of his daemon on the brass plate for his coffin, and her name would share the space with his.
陈述句	I should have made time before now for a talk with you, Lyra, he said after a few moments.
并列句	I was intending to do so in any case, but it seems that time is further on than I thought.
陈述句	You have been safe here in Jordan, my dear.
陈述句	I think you've been happy.
并列句	You haven't found it easy to obey us, but we are very fond of you, and you've never been a bad child.
并列句	There's a lot of goodness and sweetness in your nature, and a lot of determination.
陈述句	You're going to need all of that.
陈述句	Things are going on in the wide world I would have liked to protect you from-by keeping you here in Jordan, I mean-but that's no longer possible.
陈述句	She merely stared.
疑问句	Were they going to send her away?
陈述句	You knew that sometime you'd have to go to school, the Master went on.
并列句	We have taught you some things here, but not well or systematically.
陈述句	Our knowledge is of a different kind.
陈述句	You need to know things that elderly men are not able to teach you, especially at the age you are now.
陈述句	You must have been aware of that.
陈述句	You're not a servant's child either; we couldn't put you out to be fostered by a town family.
并列句	They might have cared for you in some ways, but your needs are different.
陈述句	You see, what I'm saying to you, Lyra, is that the part of your life that belongs to Jordan College is coming to an end.
陈述句	No, she said, no, I don't want to leave Jordan.
陈述句	I like it here.
陈述句	I want to stay here forever.
陈述句	When you're young, you do think that things last forever.
陈述句	Unfortunately, they don't.
并列句	Lyra, it won't be long-a couple of years at most-before you will be a young woman, and not a child anymore.
陈述句	A young lady.
并列句	And believe me, you'll find Jordan College a far from easy place to live in then.
并列句	But it's my home!
陈述句	It has been your home.
并列句	But now you need something else.
陈述句	Not school.
陈述句	I'm not going to school.
陈述句	You need female company.
陈述句	Female guidance.
并列句	The word female only suggested female Scholars to Lyra, and she involuntarily made a face.
并列句	To be exiled from the grandeur of Jordan, the splendor and fame of its scholarship, to a dingy brick-built boardinghouse of a college at the northern end of Oxford, with dowdy female Scholars who smelled of cabbage and mothballs like those two at dinner!
并列句	The Master saw her expression, and saw Pantalaimon's polecat eyes flash red.
并列句	He said, But suppose it were Mrs. Coulter?
陈述句	Instantly Pantalaimon's fur changed from coarse brown to downy white.
陈述句	Lyra's eyes widened.
疑问句	Really?
陈述句	She is by way of being acquainted with Lord Asriel.
并列句	Your uncle, of course, is very concerned with your welfare, and when Mrs. Coulter heard about you, she offered at once to help.
陈述句	There is no Mr. Coulter, by the way; she is a widow.
陈述句	Her husband died very sadly in an accident some years ago; so you might bear that in mind before you ask.
并列句	Lyra nodded eagerly, and said, And she's really going to...look after me?
疑问句	Would you like that?
感叹句	Yes!
陈述句	She could hardly sit still.
陈述句	The Master smiled.
并列句	He smiled so rarely that he was out of practice, and anyone watching (Lyra wasn't in a state to notice) would have said it was a grimace of sadness.
陈述句	Well, we had better ask her in to talk about it, he said.
并列句	He left the room, and when he came back a minute later with Mrs. Coulter, Lyra was on her feet, too excited to sit.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter smiled, and her daemon bared his white teeth in a grin of implike pleasure.
并列句	As she passed her on the way to the armchair, Mrs. Coulter touched Lyra's hair briefly, and Lyra felt a current of warmth flow into her, and blushed.
疑问句	When the Master had poured some brantwijn for her, Mrs. Coulter said, So, Lyra, I'm to have an assistant, am I?
陈述句	Yes, said Lyra simply.
陈述句	She would have said yes to anything.
陈述句	There's a lot of work I need help with.
感叹句	I can work!
并列句	And we might have to travel.
陈述句	I don't mind.
陈述句	I'd go anywhere.
并列句	But it might be dangerous.
陈述句	We might have to go to the North.
陈述句	Lyra was speechless.
疑问句	Then she found her voice: Soon?
并列句	Mrs. Coulter laughed and said, Possibly.
并列句	But you know you'll have to work very hard.
并列句	You'll have to learn mathematics, and navigation, and celestial geography.
疑问句	Will you teach me?
陈述句	Yes.
并列句	And you'll have to help me by making notes and putting my papers in order and doing various pieces of basic calculation, and so on.
原因状语从句	And because we'll be visiting some important people, we'll have to find you some pretty clothes.
陈述句	There's a lot to learn, Lyra.
陈述句	I don't mind.
陈述句	I want to learn it all.
陈述句	I'm sure you will.
陈述句	When you come back to Jordan College, you'll be a famous traveler.
并列句	Now we're going to leave very early in the morning, by the dawn zeppelin, so you'd better run along and go straight to bed.
陈述句	I'll see you at breakfast.
感叹句	Goodnight!
并列句	Goodnight, said Lyra, and, remembering the few manners she had, turned at the door and said, Goodnight, Master.
陈述句	He nodded.
陈述句	Sleep well, he said.
并列句	And thanks, Lyra added to Mrs. Coulter.
让步状语从句	She did sleep, finally, though Pantalaimon wouldn't settle until she snapped at him, when he became a hedgehog out of pique.
陈述句	It was still dark when someone shook her awake.
陈述句	Lyra-hush-don't start-wake up, child.
陈述句	It was Mrs. Lonsdale.
并列句	She was holding a candle, and she bent over and spoke quietly, holding Lyra still with her free hand.
陈述句	Listen.
陈述句	The Master wants to see you before you join Mrs. Coulter for breakfast.
并列句	Get up quickly and run across to the lodging now.
并列句	Go into the garden and tap at the French window of the study.
疑问句	You understand?
并列句	Fully awake and on fire with puzzlement, Lyra nodded and slipped her bare feet into the shoes Mrs. Lonsdale put down for her.
陈述句	Never mind washing-that'll do later.
并列句	Go straight down and come straight back.
并列句	I'll start your packing and have something for you to wear.
陈述句	Hurry now.
陈述句	The dark quadrangle was still full of the chill night air.
并列句	Overhead the last stars were still visible, but the light from the east was gradually soaking into the sky above the Hall.
并列句	Lyra ran into the Library Garden, and stood for a moment in the immense hush, looking up at the stone pinnacles of the chapel, the pearl-green cupola of the Sheldon Building, the white-painted lantern of the Library.
陈述句	Now that she was going to leave these sights, she wondered how much she'd miss them.
并列句	Something stirred in the study window and a glow of light shone out for a moment.
并列句	She remembered what she had to do and tapped on the glass door.
陈述句	It opened almost at once.
陈述句	Good girl.
陈述句	Come in quickly.
并列句	We haven't got long, said the Master, and drew the curtain back across the door as soon as she had entered.
陈述句	He was fully dressed in his usual black.
疑问句	Aren't I going after all?
陈述句	Lyra asked.
并列句	Yes; I can't prevent it, said the Master, and Lyra didn't notice at the time what an odd thing that was to say.
并列句	Lyra, I'm going to give you something, and you must promise to keep it private.
疑问句	Will you swear to that?
陈述句	Yes, Lyra said.
并列句	He crossed to the desk and took from a drawer a small package wrapped in black velvet.
并列句	When he unfolded the cloth, Lyra saw something like a large watch or a small clock: a thick disk of gold and crystal.
并列句	It might have been a compass or something of the sort.
疑问句	What is it?
陈述句	she said.
陈述句	It's an alethiometer.
陈述句	It's one of only six that were ever made.
陈述句	Lyra, I urge you again: keep it private.
条件状语从句	It would be better if Mrs. Coulter didn't know about it.
并列句	Your uncle- But what does it do?
陈述句	It tells you the truth.
陈述句	As for how to read it, you'll have to learn by yourself.
陈述句	Now go-it's getting lighter-hurry back to your room before anyone sees you.
并列句	He folded the velvet over the instrument and thrust it into her hands.
陈述句	It was surprisingly heavy.
并列句	Then he put his own hands on either side of her head and held her gently for a moment.
并列句	She tried to look up at him, and said, What were you going to say about Uncle Asriel?
陈述句	Your uncle presented it to Jordan College some years ago.
陈述句	He might- Before he could finish, there came a soft urgent knock on the door.
陈述句	She could feel his hands give an involuntary tremor.
陈述句	Quick now, child, he said quietly.
陈述句	The powers of this world are very strong.
并列句	Men and women are moved by tides much fiercer than you can imagine, and they sweep us all up into the current.
陈述句	Go well, Lyra; bless you, child, bless you.
陈述句	Keep your own counsel.
陈述句	Thank you, Master, she said dutifully.
陈述句	Clutching the bundle to her breast, she left the study by the garden door, looking back briefly once to see the Master's daemon watching her from the windowsill.
陈述句	The sky was lighter already; there was a faint fresh stir in the air.
疑问句	What's that you've got?
陈述句	said Mrs. Lonsdale, closing the battered little suitcase with a snap.
陈述句	The Master gave it me.
疑问句	Can't it go in the suitcase?
陈述句	Too late.
陈述句	I'm not opening it now.
陈述句	It'll have to go in your coat pocket, whatever it is.
陈述句	Hurry on down to the buttery; don't keep them waiting....
并列句	It was only after she'd said goodbye to the few servants who were up, and to Mrs. Lonsdale, that she remembered Roger; and then she felt guilty for not having thought of him once since meeting Mrs. Coulter.
感叹句	How quickly it had all happened!
并列句	But no doubt Mrs. Coulter would help her look for him, and she was bound to have powerful friends who could get him back from wherever he'd disappeared to.
陈述句	He was bound to turn up eventually.
并列句	And now she was on her way to London: sitting next to the window in a zeppelin, no less, with Pantalaimon's sharp little ermine paws digging into her thigh while his front paws rested against the glass he gazed through.
并列句	On Lyra's other side Mrs. Coulter sat working through some papers, but she soon put them away and talked.
感叹句	Such brilliant talk!
并列句	Lyra was intoxicated; not about the North this time, but about London, and the restaurants and ballrooms, the soirees at embassies or ministries, the intrigues between White Hall and Westminster.
陈述句	Lyra was almost more fascinated by this than by the changing landscape below the airship.
并列句	What Mrs. Coulter was saying seemed to be accompanied by a scent of grownupness, something disturbing but enticing at the same time: it was the smell of glamour.
并列句	* * *  The landing in Falkeshall Gardens, the boat ride across the wide brown river, the grand mansion block on the Embankment where a stout commissionaire (a sort of porter with medals) saluted Mrs. Coulter and winked at Lyra, who sized him up expressionlessly.
并列句	And then the flat... Lyra could only gasp.
并列句	She had seen a great deal of beauty in her short life, but it was Jordan College beauty, Oxford beauty-grand and stony and masculine.
并列句	In Jordan College, much was magnificent, but nothing was pretty.
陈述句	In Mrs. Coulter's flat, everything was pretty.
并列句	It was full of light, for the wide windows faced south, and the walls were covered in a delicate gold-and-white striped wallpaper.
并列句	Charming pictures in gilt frames, an antique looking-glass, fanciful sconces bearing anbaric lamps with frilled shades; and frills on the cushions too, and flowery valances over the curtain rail, and a soft green leaf-pattern carpet underfoot; and every surface was covered, it seemed to Lyra's innocent eye, with pretty little china boxes and shepherdesses and harlequins of porcelain.
陈述句	Mrs. Coulter smiled at her admiration.
感叹句	Yes, Lyra, she said, there's such a lot to show you!
并列句	Take your coat off and I'll take you to the bathroom.
并列句	You can have a wash, and then we'll have some lunch and go shopping....
陈述句	The bathroom was another wonder.
并列句	Lyra was used to washing with hard yellow soap in a chipped basin, where the water that struggled out of the taps was warm at best, and often flecked with rust.
并列句	But here the water was hot, the soap rose-pink and fragrant, the towels thick and cloud-soft.
并列句	And around the edge of the tinted mirror there were little pink lights, so that when Lyra looked into it she saw a softly illuminated figure quite unlike the Lyra she knew.
陈述句	Pantalaimon, who was imitating the form of Mrs. Coulter's daemon, crouched on the edge of the basin making faces at her.
并列句	She pushed him into the soapy water and suddenly remembered the alethiometer in her coat pocket.
陈述句	She'd left the coat on a chair in the other room.
陈述句	She'd promised the Master to keep it secret from Mrs. Coulter.... Oh, this was confusing.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter was so kind and wise, whereas Lyra had actually seen the Master trying to poison Uncle Asriel.
疑问句	Which of them did she owe most obedience to?
并列句	She rubbed herself dry hastily and hurried back to the sitting room, where her coat still lay untouched, of course.
疑问句	Ready?
陈述句	said Mrs. Coulter.
陈述句	I thought we'd go to the Royal Arctic Institute for lunch.
陈述句	I'm one of the very few female members, so I might as well use the privileges I have.
并列句	Twenty minutes' walk took them to a grand stone-fronted building where they sat in a wide dining room with snowy cloths and bright silver on the tables, and ate calves' liver and bacon.
并列句	Calves' liver is all right, Mrs. Coulter told her, and so is seal liver, but if you're stuck for food in the Arctic, you mustn't eat bear liver.
陈述句	That's full of a poison that'll kill you in minutes.
陈述句	As they ate, Mrs. Coulter pointed out some of the members at the other tables.
疑问句	D'you see the elderly gentleman with the red tie?
陈述句	That's Colonel Carborn.
陈述句	He made the first balloon flight over the North Pole.
并列句	And the tall man by the window who's just got up is Dr.
陈述句	Broken Arrow.
疑问句	Is he a Skraeling?
陈述句	Yes.
并列句	He was the man who mapped the ocean currents in the Great Northern Ocean.... Lyra looked at them all, these great men, with curiosity and awe.
并列句	They were Scholars, no doubt about that, but they were explorers too.
陈述句	Dr.
陈述句	Broken Arrow would know about bear livers; she doubted whether the Librarian of Jordan College would.
陈述句	After lunch Mrs. Coulter showed her some of the precious arctic relics in the institute library-the harpoon with which the great whale Grimssdur had been killed; the stone carved with an inscription in an unknown language which was found in the hand of the explorer Lord Rukh, frozen to death in his lonely tent; a fire-striker used by Captain Hudson on his famous voyage to Van Tieren's Land.
并列句	She told the story of each one, and Lyra felt her heart stir with admiration for these great, brave, distant heroes.
并列句	And then they went shopping.
并列句	Everything on this extraordinary day was a new experience for Lyra, but shopping was the most dizzying.
并列句	To go into a vast building full of beautiful clothes, where people let you try them on, where you looked at yourself in mirrors...And the clothes were so pretty....Lyra's clothes had come to her through Mrs. Lonsdale, and a lot of them had been handed down and much mended.
并列句	She had seldom had anything new, and when she had, it had been picked for wear and not for looks; and she had never chosen anything for herself.
并列句	And now to find Mrs. Coulter suggesting this, and praising that, and paying for it all, and more... By the time they'd finished, Lyra was flushed and bright-eyed with tiredness.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter ordered most of the clothes packed up and delivered, and took one or two things with her when she and Lyra walked back to the flat.
陈述句	Then a bath, with thick scented foam.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter came into the bathroom to wash Lyra's hair, and she didn't rub and scrape like Mrs. Lonsdale either.
陈述句	She was gentle.
并列句	Pantalaimon watched with powerful curiosity until Mrs. Coulter looked at him, and he knew what she meant and turned away, averting his eyes modestly from these feminine mysteries as the golden monkey was doing.
陈述句	He had never had to look away from Lyra before.
并列句	Then, after the bath, a warm drink with milk and herbs; and a new flannel nightdress with printed flowers and a seal' loped hem, and sheepskin slippers dyed soft blue; and then bed.
感叹句	So soft, this bed!
感叹句	So gentle, the anbaric light on the bed' side table!
并列句	And the bedroom so cozy with little cupboards and a dressing table and a chest of drawers where her new clothes would go, and a carpet from one wall to the other, and pretty curtains covered in stars and moons and planets!
陈述句	Lyra lay stiffly, too tired to sleep, too enchanted to question anything.
并列句	When Mrs. Coulter had wished her a soft goodnight and gone out, Pantalaimon plucked at her hair.
并列句	She brushed him away, but he whispered, Where's the thing?
陈述句	She knew at once what he meant.
并列句	Her old shabby overcoat hung in the wardrobe; a few seconds later, she was back in bed, sitting up cross-legged in the lamplight, with Pantalaimon watching closely as she unfolded the black velvet and looked at what it was the Master had given her.
疑问句	What did he call it?
陈述句	she whispered.
陈述句	An alethiometer.
陈述句	There was no point in asking what that meant.
陈述句	It lay heavily in her hands, the crystal face gleaming, the golden body exquisitely machined.
并列句	It was very like a clock, or a compass, for there were hands pointing to places around the dial, but instead of the hours or the points of the compass there were several little pictures, each of them painted with extraordinary precision, as if on ivory with the finest and slenderest sable brush.
陈述句	She turned the dial around to look at them all.
并列句	There was an anchor; an hourglass surmounted by a skull; a chameleon, a bull, a beehive...Thirty-six altogether, and she couldn't even guess what they meant.
陈述句	There's a wheel, look, said Pantalaimon.
条件状语从句	See if you can wind it up.
并列句	There were three little knurled winding wheels, in fact, and each of them turned one of the three shorter hands, which moved around the dial in a series of smooth satisfying clicks.
并列句	You could arrange them to point at any of the pictures, and once they had clicked into position, pointing exactly at the center of each one, they would not move.
并列句	The fourth hand was longer and more slender, and seemed to be made of a duller metal than the other three.
陈述句	Lyra couldn't control its movement at all; it swung where it wanted to, like a compass needle, except that it didn't settle.
陈述句	Meter means measure, said Pantalaimon.
陈述句	Like thermometer.
陈述句	The Chaplain told us that.
并列句	Yes, but that's the easy bit, she whispered back.
疑问句	What d'you think it's for?
陈述句	Neither of them could guess.
并列句	Lyra spent a long time turning the hands to point at one symbol or another (angel, helmet, dolphin; globe, lute, compasses; candle, thunderbolt, horse) and watching the long needle swing on its never-ceasing errant way, and although she understood nothing, she was intrigued and delighted by the complexity and the detail.
并列句	Pantalaimon became a mouse to get closer to it, and rested his tiny paws on the edge, his button eyes bright black with curiosity as he watched the needle swing.
疑问句	What do you think the Master meant about Uncle Asriel?
陈述句	she said.
并列句	Perhaps we've got to keep it safe and give it to him.
并列句	But the Master was going to poison him!
陈述句	Perhaps it's the opposite.
陈述句	Perhaps he was going to say don't give it to him.
陈述句	No, Pantalaimon said, it was her we had to keep it safe from- There was a soft knock on the door.
条件状语从句	Mrs. Coulter said, Lyra, I should put the light out if I were you.
并列句	You're tired, and we'll be busy tomorrow.
陈述句	Lyra had thrust the alethiometer swiftly under the blankets.
陈述句	All right, Mrs. Coulter, she said.
陈述句	Goodnight now.
陈述句	Goodnight.
并列句	She snuggled down and switched off the light.
陈述句	Before she fell asleep, she tucked the alethiometer under the pillow, just in case.
条件状语从句	Five THE COCKTAIL PARTY     In the days that followed, Lyra went everywhere with Mrs. Coulter, almost as if she were a daemon herself.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter knew a great many people, and they met in all kinds of different places: in the morning there might be a meeting of geographers at the Royal Arctic Institute, and Lyra would sit by and listen; and then Mrs. Coulter might meet a politician or a cleric for lunch in a smart restaurant, and they would be very taken with Lyra and order special dishes for her, and she would learn how to eat asparagus or what sweetbreads tasted like.
并列句	And then in the afternoon there might be more shopping, for Mrs. Coulter was preparing her expedition, and there were furs and oilskins and waterproof boots to buy, as well as sleeping bags and knives and drawing instruments that delighted Lyra's heart.
并列句	After that they might go to tea and meet some ladies, as well dressed as Mrs. Coulter if not so beautiful or accomplished: women so unlike female Scholars or gyptian boat mothers or college servants as almost to be a new sex altogether, one with dangerous powers and qualities such as elegance, charm, and grace.
并列句	Lyra would be dressed up prettily for these occasions, and the ladies would pamper her and include her in their graceful delicate talk, which was all about people: this artist, or that politician, or those lovers.
并列句	And when the evening came, Mrs. Coulter might take Lyra to the theater, and again there would be lots of glamorous people to talk to and be admired by, for it seemed that Mrs. Coulter knew everyone important in London.
并列句	In the intervals between all these other activities Mrs. Coulter would teach her the rudiments of geography and mathematics.
并列句	Lyra's knowledge had great gaps in it, like a map of the world largely eaten by mice, for at Jordan they had taught her in a piecemeal and disconnected way: a junior Scholar would be detailed to catch her and instruct her in such-and-such, and the lessons would continue for a sullen week or so until she forgot to turn up, to the Scholar's relief.
并列句	Or else a Scholar would forget what he was supposed to teach her, and drill her at great length about the subject of his current research, whatever that happened to be.
陈述句	It was no wonder her knowledge was patchy.
并列句	She knew about atoms and elementary particles, and anbaromagnetic charges and the four fundamental forces and other bits and pieces of experimental theology, but nothing about the solar system.
并列句	In fact, when Mrs. Coulter realized this and explained how the earth and the other five planets revolved around the sun, Lyra laughed loudly at the joke.
并列句	However, she was keen to show that she did know some things, and when Mrs. Coulter was telling her about electrons, she said expertly, Yes, they're negatively charged particles.
陈述句	Sort of like Dust, except that Dust isn't charged.
并列句	As soon as she said that, Mrs. Coulter's daemon snapped his head up to look at her, and all the golden fur on his little body stood up, bristling, as if it were charged itself.
陈述句	Mrs. Coulter laid a hand on his back.
疑问句	Dust?
陈述句	she said.
陈述句	Yeah.
陈述句	You know, from space, that Dust.
疑问句	What do you know about Dust, Lyra?
并列句	Oh, that it comes out of space, and it lights people up, if you have a special sort of camera to see it by.
陈述句	Except not children.
陈述句	It doesn't affect children.
疑问句	Where did you learn that from?
原因状语从句	By now Lyra was aware that there was a powerful tension in the room, because Pantalaimon had crept ermine-like onto her lap and was trembling violently.
陈述句	Just someone in Jordan, Lyra said vaguely.
陈述句	I forget who.
陈述句	I think it was one of the Scholars.
疑问句	Was it in one of your lessons?
陈述句	Yes, it might have been.
并列句	Or else it might've been just in passing.
陈述句	Yes.
陈述句	I think that was it.
并列句	This Scholar, I think he was from New Denmark, he was talking to the Chaplain about Dust and I was just passing and it sounded interesting so I couldn't help stopping to listen.
陈述句	That's what it was.
陈述句	I see, said Mrs. Coulter.
疑问句	Is it right, what he told me?
疑问句	Did I get it wrong?
陈述句	Well, I don't know.
陈述句	I'm sure you know much more than I do.
疑问句	Let's get back to those electrons.... Later, Pantalaimon said, You know when all the fur stood up on her daemon?
并列句	Well, I was behind him, and she grabbed his fur so tight her knuckles went white.
陈述句	You couldn't see.
陈述句	It was a long time till his fur went down.
陈述句	I thought he was going to leap at you.
并列句	That was strange, no doubt; but neither of them knew what to make of it.
并列句	And finally, there were other kinds of lessons so gently and subtly given that they didn't feel like lessons at all.
陈述句	How to wash one's own hair; how to judge which colors suited one; how to say no in such a charming way that no offense was given; how to put on lipstick, powder, scent.
并列句	To be sure, Mrs. Coulter didn't teach Lyra the latter arts directly, but she knew Lyra was watching when she made herself up, and she took care to let Lyra see where she kept the cosmetics, and to allow her time on her own to explore and try them out for herself.
并列句	* * *  Time passed, and autumn began to change into winter.
并列句	From time to time Lyra thought of Jordan College, but it seemed small and quiet compared to the busy life she led now.
并列句	Every so often she thought of Roger, too, and felt uneasy, but there was an opera to go to, or a new dress to wear, or the Royal Arctic Institute to visit, and then she forgot him again.
并列句	When Lyra had been living there for six weeks or so, Mrs. Coulter decided to hold a cocktail party.
让步状语从句	Lyra had the impression that there was something to celebrate, though Mrs. Coulter never said what it was.
并列句	She ordered flowers, she discussed canapes and drinks with the caterer, and she spent a whole evening with Lyra deciding whom to invite.
陈述句	We must have the archbishop.
让步状语从句	I couldn't afford to leave him out, though he's the most hateful old snob.
陈述句	Lord Boreal is in town: he'll be fun.
并列句	And the Princess Postnikova.
疑问句	Do you think it would be right to invite Erik Andersson?
条件状语从句	I wonder if it's about time to take him up.... Erik Andersson was the latest fashionable dancer.
并列句	Lyra had no idea what take him up meant, but she enjoyed giving her opinion nonetheless.
并列句	She dutifully wrote down all the names Mrs. Coulter suggested, spelling them atrociously and then crossing them out when Mrs. Coulter decided against them after all.
感叹句	When Lyra went to bed, Pantalaimon whispered from the pillow: She's never going to the North!
陈述句	She's going to keep us here forever.
疑问句	When are we going to run away?
陈述句	She is, Lyra whispered back.
陈述句	You just don't like her.
陈述句	Well, that's hard luck.
陈述句	I like her.
并列句	And why would she be teaching us navigation and all that if she wasn't going to take us north?
陈述句	To stop you getting impatient, that's why.
并列句	You don't really want to stand around at the cocktail party being all sweet and pretty.
陈述句	She's just making a pet out of you.
并列句	Lyra turned her back and closed her eyes.
并列句	But what Pantalaimon said was true.
并列句	She had been feeling confined and cramped by this polite life, however luxurious it was.
并列句	She would have given anything for a day with Roger and her Oxford ragamuffin friends, with a battle in the claybeds and a race along the canal.
并列句	The one thing that kept her polite and attentive to Mrs. Coulter was that tantalizing hope of going north.
陈述句	Perhaps they would meet Lord Asriel.
并列句	Perhaps he and Mrs. Coulter would fall in love, and they would get married and adopt Lyra, and go and rescue Roger from the Gobblers.
并列句	On the afternoon of the cocktail party, Mrs. Coulter took Lyra to a fashionable hairdresser's, where her stiff dark blond hair was softened and waved, and her nails were filed and polished, and where they even applied a little makeup to her eyes and lips to show her how to do it.
并列句	Then they went to collect the new dress Mrs. Coulter had ordered for her, and to buy some patent-leather shoes, and then it was time to go back to the flat and check the flowers and get dressed.
陈述句	Not the shoulder bag, dear, said Mrs. Coulter as Lyra came out of her bedroom, glowing with a sense of her own prettiness.
陈述句	Lyra had taken to wearing a little white leather shoulder bag everywhere, so as to keep the alethiometer close at hand.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter, loosening the cramped way some roses had been bunched into a vase, saw that Lyra wasn't moving and glanced pointedly at the door.
感叹句	Oh, please, Mrs. Coulter, I do love this bag!
陈述句	Not indoors, Lyra.
陈述句	It looks absurd to be carrying a shoulder bag in your own home.
并列句	Take it off at once, and come and help check these glasses....
陈述句	It wasn't so much her snappish tone as the words in your own home that made Lyra resist stubbornly.
并列句	Pantalaimon flew to the floor and instantly became a polecat, arching his back against her little white ankle socks.
并列句	Encouraged by this, Lyra said: But it won't be in the way.
并列句	And it's the only thing I really like wearing.
原因状语从句	I think it really suits- She didn't finish the sentence, because Mrs. Coulter's daemon sprang off the sofa in a blur of golden fur and pinned Pantalaimon to the carpet before he could move.
并列句	Lyra cried out in alarm, and then in fear and pain, as Pantalaimon twisted this way and that, shrieking and snarling, unable to loosen the golden monkey's grip.
并列句	Only a few seconds, and the monkey had overmastered him: with one fierce black paw around his throat and his black paws gripping the polecat's lower limbs, he took one of Pantalaimon's ears in his other paw and pulled as if he intended to tear it off.
并列句	Not angrily, either, but with a cold curious force that was horrifying to see and even worse to feel.
陈述句	Lyra sobbed in terror.
感叹句	Don't!
感叹句	Please!
感叹句	Stop hurting us!
陈述句	Mrs. Coulter looked up from her flowers.
陈述句	Do as I tell you, then, she said.
感叹句	I promise!
条件状语从句	The golden monkey stepped away from Pantalaimon as if he were suddenly bored.
并列句	Pantalaimon fled to Lyra at once, and she scooped him up to her face to kiss and gentle.
陈述句	Now, Lyra, said Mrs. Coulter.
并列句	Lyra turned her back abruptly and slammed into her bedroom, but no sooner had she banged the door shut behind her than it opened again.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter was standing there only a foot or two away.
并列句	Lyra, if you behave in this coarse and vulgar way, we shall have a confrontation, which I will win.
陈述句	Take off that bag this instant.
陈述句	Control that unpleasant frown.
并列句	Never slam a door again in my hearing or out of it.
并列句	Now, the first guests will be arriving in a few minutes, and they are going to find you perfectly behaved, sweet, charming, innocent, attentive, delightful in every way.
疑问句	I particularly wish for that, Lyra, do you understand me?
陈述句	Yes, Mrs. Coulter.
陈述句	Then kiss me.
并列句	She bent a little and offered her cheek.
陈述句	Lyra had to stand on tiptoe to kiss it.
并列句	She noticed how smooth it was, and the slight perplexing smell of Mrs. Coulter's flesh: scented, but somehow metallic.
并列句	She drew away and laid the shoulder bag on her dressing table before following Mrs. Coulter back to the drawing room.
疑问句	What do you think of the flowers, dear?
条件状语从句	said Mrs. Coulter as sweetly as if nothing had happened.
并列句	I suppose one can't go wrong with roses, but you can have too much of a good thing....Have the caterers brought enough ice?
并列句	Be a dear and go and ask.
并列句	Warm drinks are horrid... Lyra found it was quite easy to pretend to be lighthearted and charming, though she was conscious every second of Pantalaimon's disgust, and of his hatred for the golden monkey.
并列句	Presently the doorbell rang, and soon the room was filling up with fashionably dressed ladies and handsome or distinguished men.
并列句	Lyra moved among them offering canapes or smiling sweetly and making pretty answers when they spoke to her.
并列句	She felt like a universal pet, and the second she voiced that thought to herself, Pantalaimon stretched his goldfinch wings and chirruped loudly.
并列句	She sensed his glee at having proved her right, and became a little more retiring.
并列句	And where do you go to school, my dear?
陈述句	said an elderly lady, inspecting Lyra through a lorgnette.
陈述句	I don't go to school, Lyra told her.
疑问句	Really?
陈述句	I thought your mother would have sent you to her old school.
陈述句	A very good place... Lyra was mystified until she realized the old lady's mistake.
感叹句	Oh!
感叹句	She's not my mother!
陈述句	I'm just here helping her.
陈述句	I'm her personal assistant, she said importantly.
陈述句	I see.
并列句	And who are your people?
陈述句	Again Lyra had to wonder what she meant before replying.
并列句	They were a count and countess, she said.
陈述句	They both died in an aeronautical accident in the North.
疑问句	Which count?
陈述句	Count Belacqua.
陈述句	He was Lord Asriel's brother.
条件状语从句	The old lady's daemon, a scarlet macaw, shifted as if in irritation from one foot to another.
并列句	The old lady was beginning to frown with curiosity, so Lyra smiled sweetly and moved on.
并列句	She was going past a group of men and one young woman near the large sofa when she heard the word Dust.
并列句	She had seen enough of society now to understand when men and women were flirting, and she watched the process with fascination, though she was more fascinated by the mention of Dust, and she hung back to listen.
陈述句	The men seemed to be Scholars; from the way the young woman was questioning them, Lyra took her to be a student of some kind.
并列句	It was discovered by a Muscovite-stop me if you know this already- a middle-aged man was saying, as the young woman gazed at him in admiration, a man called Rusakov, and they're usually called Rusakov Particles after him.
并列句	Elementary particles that don't interact in any way with others-very hard to detect, but the extraordinary thing is that they seem to be attracted to human beings.
疑问句	Really?
陈述句	said the young woman, wide-eyed.
并列句	And even more extraordinary, he went on, some human beings more than others.
并列句	Adults attract it, but not children.
并列句	At least, not much, and not until adolescence.
并列句	In fact, that's the very reason- His voice dropped, and he moved closer to the young woman, putting his hand confidentially on her shoulder.
陈述句	-that's the very reason the Oblation Board was set up.
陈述句	As our good hostess here could tell you.
疑问句	Really?
疑问句	Is she involved with the Oblation Board?
陈述句	My dear, she is the Oblation Board.
陈述句	It's entirely her own project- The man was about to tell her more when he caught sight of Lyra.
并列句	She stared back at him unblinkingly, and perhaps he had had a little too much to drink, or perhaps he was keen to impress the young woman, for he said: This little lady knows all about it, I'll be bound.
疑问句	You're safe from the Oblation Board, aren't you, my dear?
陈述句	Oh, yes, said Lyra.
陈述句	I'm safe from everyone here.
陈述句	Where I used to live, in Oxford, there was all kinds of dangerous things.
并列句	There was gyptians-they take kids and sell 'em to the Turks for slaves.
并列句	And on Port Meadow at the full moon there's a werewolf that comes out from the old nunnery at Godstow.
陈述句	I heard him howling once.
并列句	And there's the Gobblers.... That's what I mean, the man said.
疑问句	That's what they call the Oblation Board, don't they?
并列句	Lyra felt Pantalaimon tremble suddenly, but he was on his best behavior.
并列句	The daemons of the two grownups, a cat and a butterfly, didn't seem to notice.
疑问句	Gobblers?
陈述句	said the young woman.
感叹句	What a peculiar name!
疑问句	Why do they call them Gobblers?
并列句	Lyra was about to tell her one of the bloodcurdling stories she'd made up to frighten the Oxford kids with, but the man was already speaking.
疑问句	From the initials, d'you see?
陈述句	General Oblation Board.
陈述句	Very old idea, as a matter of fact.
并列句	In the Middle Ages, parents would give their children to the church to be monks or nuns.
并列句	And the unfortunate brats were known as oblates.
陈述句	Means a sacrifice, an offering, something of that sort.
陈述句	So the same idea was taken up when they were looking into the Dust business....As our little friend probably knows.
并列句	Why don't you go and talk to Lord Boreal?
陈述句	he added to Lyra directly.
并列句	I'm sure he'd like to meet Mrs. Coulter's protegee....That's him, the man with gray hair and the serpent daemon.
陈述句	He wanted to get rid of Lyra so that he could talk more privately with the young woman; Lyra could tell that easily.
并列句	But the young woman, it seemed, was still interested in Lyra, and slipped away from the man to talk to her.
疑问句	Stop a minute....What's your name?
陈述句	Lyra.
陈述句	I'm Adele Starminster.
陈述句	I'm a journalist.
疑问句	Could I have a quiet word?
陈述句	Thinking it only natural that people should wish to talk to her, Lyra said simply, Yes.
并列句	The woman's butterfly daemon rose into the air, casting about to left and right, and fluttered down to whisper something, at which Adele Starminster said, Come to the window seat.
并列句	This was a favorite spot of Lyra's; it overlooked the river, and at this time of night, the lights across on the south bank were glittering brilliantly over their reflections in the black water of the high tide.
陈述句	A line of barges hauled by a tug moved upriver.
并列句	Adele Starminster sat down and moved along the cushioned seat to make room.
疑问句	Did Professor Docker say that you had some connection with Mrs. Coulter?
陈述句	Yes.
疑问句	What is it?
疑问句	You're not her daughter, by any chance?
感叹句	I suppose I should know- No!
陈述句	said Lyra.
陈述句	'Course not.
陈述句	I'm her personal assistant.
疑问句	Her personal assistant?
疑问句	You're a bit young, aren't you?
并列句	I thought you were related to her or something.
疑问句	What's she like?
陈述句	She's very clever, said Lyra.
并列句	Before this evening she would have said much more, but things were changing.
并列句	Yes, but personally, Adele Starminster insisted.
并列句	I mean, is she friendly or impatient or what?
疑问句	Do you live here with her?
疑问句	What's she like in private?
陈述句	She's very nice, said Lyra stolidly.
疑问句	What sort of things do you do?
疑问句	How do you help her?
并列句	I do calculations and all that.
陈述句	Like for navigation.
疑问句	Ah, I see....And where do you come from?
疑问句	What was your name again?
陈述句	Lyra.
陈述句	I come from Oxford.
原因状语从句	Why did Mrs. Coulter pick you to- She stopped very suddenly, because Mrs. Coulter herself had appeared close by.
并列句	From the way Adele Starminster looked up at her, and the agitated way her daemon was fluttering around her head, Lyra could tell that the young woman wasn't supposed to be at the party at all.
并列句	I don't know your name, said Mrs. Coulter very quietly, but I shall find it out within five minutes, and then you will never work as a journalist again.
并列句	Now get up very quietly, without making a fuss, and leave.
陈述句	I might add that whoever brought you here will also suffer.
陈述句	Mrs. Coulter seemed to be charged with some kind of anbaric force.
陈述句	She even smelled different: a hot smell, like heated metal, came off her body.
并列句	Lyra had felt something of it earlier, but now she was seeing it directed at someone else, and poor Adele Starminster had no force to resist.
并列句	Her daemon fell limp on her shoulder and flapped his gorgeous wings once or twice before fainting, and the woman herself seemed to be unable to stand fully upright.
并列句	Moving in a slight awkward crouch, she made her way through the press of loudly talking guests and out of the drawing room door.
陈述句	She had one hand clutched to her shoulder, holding the swooning daemon in place.
疑问句	Well?
陈述句	said Mrs. Coulter to Lyra.
陈述句	I never told her anything important, Lyra said.
疑问句	What was she asking?
并列句	Just about what I was doing and who I was, and stuff like that.
陈述句	As she said that, Lyra noticed that Mrs. Coulter was alone, without her daemon.
疑问句	How could that be?
并列句	But a moment later the golden monkey appeared at her side, and, reaching down, she took his hand and swung him up lightly to her shoulder.
陈述句	At once she seemed at ease again.
并列句	If you come across anyone else who obviously hasn't been invited, dear, do come and find me, won't you?
陈述句	The hot metallic smell was vanishing.
陈述句	Perhaps Lyra had only imagined it.
并列句	She could smell Mrs. Coulter's scent again, and the roses, and the cigarillo smoke, and the scent of other women.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter smiled at Lyra in a way that seemed to say, You and I understand these things, don't we?
并列句	and moved on to greet some other guests.
陈述句	Pantalaimon was whispering in Lyra's ear.
陈述句	While she was here, her daemon was coming out of our bedroom.
陈述句	He's been spying.
感叹句	He knows about the alethiometer!
并列句	Lyra felt that that was probably true, but there was nothing she could do about it.
疑问句	What had that professor been saying about the Gobblers?
并列句	She looked around to find him again, but no sooner had she seen him than the commissionaire (in servant's dress for the evening) and another man tapped the professor on the shoulder and spoke quietly to him, at which he turned pale and followed them out.
并列句	That took no more than a couple of seconds, and it was so discreetly done that hardly anyone noticed.
并列句	But it left Lyra feeling anxious and exposed.
并列句	She wandered through the two big rooms where the party was taking place, half-listening to the conversations around her, half-interested in the taste of the cocktails she wasn't allowed to try, and increasingly fretful.
并列句	She wasn't aware that anyone was watching her until the commissionaire appeared at her side and bent to say: Miss Lyra, the gentleman by the fireplace would like to speak to you.
条件状语从句	He's Lord Boreal, if you didn't know.
陈述句	Lyra looked up across the room.
并列句	The powerful-looking gray-haired man was looking directly at her, and as their eyes met, he nodded and beckoned.
并列句	Unwilling, but more interested now, she went across.
陈述句	Good evening, child, he said.
并列句	His voice was smooth and commanding.
并列句	His serpent daemon's mailed head and emerald eyes glittered in the light from the cut-glass lamp on the wall nearby.
陈述句	Good evening, said Lyra.
疑问句	How is my old friend the Master of Jordan?
陈述句	Very well, thank you.
陈述句	I expect they were all sorry to say goodbye to you.
陈述句	Yes, they were.
并列句	And is Mrs. Coulter keeping you busy?
疑问句	What is she teaching you?
原因状语从句	Because Lyra was feeling rebellious and uneasy, she didn't answer this patronizing question with the truth, or with one of her usual flights of fancy.
并列句	Instead she said, I'm learning about Rusakov Particles, and about the Oblation Board.
陈述句	He seemed to become focused at once, in the same way that you could focus the beam of an anbaric lantern.
陈述句	All his attention streamed at her fiercely.
陈述句	Suppose you tell me what you know, he said.
陈述句	They're doing experiments in the North, Lyra said.
陈述句	She was feeling reckless now.
陈述句	Like Dr. Grumman.
陈述句	Go on.
并列句	They've got this special kind of photogram where you can see Dust, and when you see a man, there's like all light coming to him, and there's none on a child.
陈述句	At least, not so much.
疑问句	Did Mrs. Coulter show you a picture like that?
并列句	Lyra hesitated, for this was not lying but something else, and she wasn't practiced at it.
陈述句	No, she said after a moment.
陈述句	I saw that one at Jordan College.
疑问句	Who showed it to you?
陈述句	He wasn't really showing it to me, Lyra admitted.
并列句	I was just passing and I saw it.
并列句	And then my friend Roger was taken by the Oblation Board.
疑问句	But- Who showed you that picture?
陈述句	My Uncle Asriel.
疑问句	When?
陈述句	When he was in Jordan College last time.
陈述句	I see.
并列句	And what else have you been learning about?
疑问句	Did I hear you mention the Oblation Board?
陈述句	Yes.
并列句	But I didn't hear about that from him, I heard it here.
陈述句	Which was exactly true, she thought.
陈述句	He was looking at her narrowly.
陈述句	She gazed back with all the innocence she had.
陈述句	Finally he nodded.
陈述句	Then Mrs. Coulter must have decided you were ready to help her in that work.
陈述句	Interesting.
疑问句	Have you taken part yet?
陈述句	No, said Lyra.
疑问句	What was he talking about?
并列句	Pantalaimon was cleverly in his most inexpressive shape, a moth, and couldn't betray her feelings; and she was sure she could keep her own face innocent.
并列句	And has she told you what happens to the children?
陈述句	No, she hasn't told me that.
并列句	I only just know that it's about Dust, and they're like a kind of sacrifice.
陈述句	Again, that wasn't exactly a lie, she thought; she had never said that Mrs. Coulter herself had told her.
陈述句	Sacrifice is rather a dramatic way of putting it.
陈述句	What's done is for their good as well as ours.
并列句	And of course they all come to Mrs. Coulter willingly.
陈述句	That's why she's so valuable.
并列句	They must want to take part, and what child could resist her?
并列句	And if she's going to use you as well to bring them in, so much the better.
陈述句	I'm very pleased.
条件状语从句	He smiled at her in the way Mrs. Coulter had: as if they were both in on a secret.
并列句	She smiled politely back and he turned away to talk to someone else.
并列句	She and Pantalaimon could sense each other's horror.
并列句	She wanted to go away by herself and talk to him; she wanted to leave the flat; she wanted to go back to Jordan College and her little shabby bedroom on Staircase Twelve; she wanted to find Lord Asriel- And as if in answer to that last wish, she heard his name mentioned, and wandered closer to the group talking nearby with the pretext of helping herself to a canape from the plate on the table.
陈述句	A man in a bishop's purple was saying: ...No, I don't think Lord Asriel will be troubling us for quite some time.
并列句	And where did you say he was being held?
陈述句	In the fortress of Svalbard, I'm told.
陈述句	Guarded by panser-bj0rne-you know, armored bears.
感叹句	Formidable creatures!
条件状语从句	He won't escape from them if he lives to be a thousand.
疑问句	The fact is that I really think the way is clear, very nearly clear- The last experiments have confirmed what I always believed-that Dust is an emanation from the dark principle itself, and- Do I detect the Zoroastrian heresy?
并列句	What used to be a heresy- And if we could isolate the dark principle- Svalbard, did you say?
陈述句	Armored bears- The Oblation Board- The children don't suffer, I'm sure of it- Lord Asriel imprisoned- Lyra had heard enough.
并列句	She turned away, and moving as quietly as the moth Pantalaimon, she went into her bedroom and closed the door.
陈述句	The noise of the party was muffled at once.
疑问句	Well?
并列句	she whispered, and he became a goldfinch on her shoulder.
疑问句	Are we going to run away?
陈述句	he whispered back.
陈述句	'Course.
条件状语从句	If we do it now with all these people about, she might not notice for a while.
陈述句	He will.
陈述句	Pantalaimon meant Mrs. Coulter's daemon.
陈述句	When Lyra thought of his lithe golden shape, she felt ill with fear.
陈述句	I'll fight him this time, Pantalaimon said boldly.
并列句	I can change and he can't.
陈述句	I'll change so quickly he won't be able to keep hold.
陈述句	This time I'll win, you'll see.
陈述句	Lyra nodded distractedly.
疑问句	What should she wear?
疑问句	How could she get out without being seen?
并列句	You'll have to go and spy, she whispered.
陈述句	As soon as it's clear, we'll have to run.
陈述句	Be a moth, she added.
并列句	Remember, the second there's no one looking... She opened the door a crack and he crawled out, dark against the warm pink light in the corridor.
并列句	Meanwhile, she hastily flung on the warmest clothes she had and stuffed some more into one of the coal-silk bags from the fashionable shop they'd visited that very afternoon.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter had given her money like sweets, and although she had spent it lavishly, there were still several sovereigns left, which she put in the pocket of the dark wolfskin coat before tiptoeing to the door.
陈述句	Last of all she packed the alethiometer in its black velvet cloth.
疑问句	Had that abominable monkey found it?
条件状语从句	He must have done; he must have told her; oh, if she'd only hidden it better!
陈述句	She tiptoed to the door.
并列句	Her room opened into the end of the corridor nearest the hall, luckily, and most of the guests were in the two big rooms further along.
并列句	There was the sound of voices talking loudly, laughter, the quiet flushing of a lavatory, the tinkle of glasses; and then a tiny moth voice at her ear said: Now!
感叹句	Quick!
并列句	She slipped through the door and into the hall, and in less than three seconds she was opening the front door of the flat.
并列句	A moment after that she was through and pulling it quietly shut, and with Pantalaimon a goldfinch again, she ran for the stairs and fled.
原因状语从句	SIX  THE THROWING NETS     She walked quickly away from the river, because the embankment was wide and well lit.
并列句	There was a tangle of narrow streets between there and the Royal Arctic Institute, which was the only place Lyra was sure of being able to find, and into that dark maze she hurried now.
条件状语从句	If only she knew London as well as she knew Oxford!
并列句	Then she would have known which streets to avoid; or where she could scrounge some food; or, best of all, which doors to knock on and find shelter.
并列句	In that cold night, the dark alleys all around were alive with movement and secret life, and she knew none of it.
并列句	Pantalaimon became a wildcat and scanned the dark all around with his night-piercing eyes.
并列句	Every so often he'd stop, bristling, and she would turn aside from the entrance she'd been about to go down.
并列句	The night was full of noises: bursts of drunken laughter, two raucous voices raised in song, the clatter and whine of some badly oiled machine in a basement.
并列句	Lyra walked delicately through it all, her senses magnified and mingled with Pantalaimon's, keeping to the shadows and the narrow alleys.
并列句	From time to time she had to cross a wider, well-lit street, where the tramcars hummed and sparked under their anbaric wires.
并列句	There were rules for crossing London streets, but she took no notice, and when anyone shouted, she fled.
陈述句	It was a fine thing to be free again.
并列句	She knew that Pantalaimon, padding on wildcat paws beside her, felt the same joy as she did to be in the open air, even if it was murky London air laden with fumes and soot and clangorous with noise.
并列句	Sometime soon they'd have to think over the meaning of what they'd heard in Mrs. Coulter's flat, but not yet.
并列句	And sometime eventually they'd have to find a place to sleep.
陈述句	At a crossroads near the corner of a big department store whose windows shone brilliantly over the wet pavement, there was a coffee stall: a little hut on wheels with a counter under the wooden flap that swung up like an awning.
并列句	Yellow light glowed inside, and the fragrance of coffee drifted out.
并列句	The white-coated owner was leaning on the counter talking to the two or three customers.
陈述句	It was tempting.
并列句	Lyra had been walking for an hour now, and it was cold and damp.
并列句	With Pantalaimon a sparrow, she went up to the counter and reached up to gain the owner's attention.
并列句	Cup of coffee and a ham sandwich, please, she said.
并列句	You're out late, my dear, said a gentleman in a top hat and white silk muffler.
陈述句	Yeah, she said, turning away from him to scan the busy intersection.
并列句	A theater nearby was just emptying, and crowds milled around the lighted foyer, calling for cabs, wrapping coats around their shoulders.
并列句	In the other direction was the entrance of a Chthonic Railway station, with more crowds pouring up and down the steps.
陈述句	Here you are, love, said the coffee stall man.
陈述句	Two shillings.
陈述句	Let me pay for this, said the man in the top hat.
疑问句	Lyra thought, why not?
并列句	I can run faster than him, and I might need all my money later.
并列句	The top-hatted man dropped a coin on the counter and smiled down at her.
陈述句	His daemon was a lemur.
陈述句	It clung to his lapel, staring round-eyed at Lyra.
并列句	She bit into her sandwich and kept her eyes on the busy street.
原因状语从句	She had no idea where she was, because she had never seen a map of London, and she didn't even know how big it was or how far she'd have to walk to find the country.
疑问句	What's your name?
陈述句	said the man.
陈述句	Alice.
陈述句	That's a pretty name.
陈述句	Let me put a drop of this into your coffee...warm you up...
陈述句	He was unscrewing the top of a silver flask.
陈述句	I don't like that, said Lyra.
陈述句	I just like coffee.
陈述句	I bet you've never had brandy like this before.
陈述句	I have.
陈述句	I was sick all over the place.
并列句	I had a whole bottle, or nearly.
陈述句	Just as you like, said the man, tilting the flask into his own cup.
疑问句	Where are you going, all alone like this?
陈述句	Going to meet my father.
并列句	And who's he?
陈述句	He's a murderer.
疑问句	He's what?
陈述句	I told you, he's a murderer.
陈述句	It's his profession.
陈述句	He's doing a job tonight.
陈述句	I got his clean clothes in here, 'cause he's usually all covered in blood when he's finished a job.
感叹句	Ah!
陈述句	You're joking.
陈述句	I en't.
并列句	The lemur uttered a soft mewing sound and clambered slowly up behind the man's head, to peer out at her.
并列句	She drank her coffee stolidly and ate the last of her sandwich.
陈述句	Goodnight, she said.
陈述句	I can see my father coming now.
陈述句	He looks a bit angry.
并列句	The top-hat man glanced around, and Lyra set off toward the theater crowd.
条件状语从句	Much as she would have liked to see the Chthonic Railway (Mrs. Coulter had said it was not really intended for people of their class), she was wary of being trapped underground; better to be out in the open, where she could run, if she had to.
并列句	On and on she walked, and the streets became darker and emptier.
并列句	It was drizzling, but even if there'd been no clouds the city sky was too tainted with light to show the stars.
并列句	Pantalaimon thought they were going north, but who could tell?
并列句	Endless streets of little identical brick houses, with gardens only big enough for a dustbin; great gaunt factories behind wire fences, with one anbaric light glowing bleakly high up on a wall and a night watchman snoozing by his brazier; occasionally a dismal oratory, only distinguished from a warehouse by the crucifix outside.
陈述句	Once she tried the door of one of these places, only to hear a groan from the bench a foot away in the darkness.
并列句	She realized that the porch was full of sleeping figures, and fled.
疑问句	Where we going to sleep, Pan?
并列句	she said as they trudged down a street of closed and shuttered shops.
陈述句	A doorway somewhere.
让步状语从句	Don't want to be seen though.
陈述句	They're all so open.
陈述句	There's a canal down there....
陈述句	He was looking down a side road to the left.
并列句	Sure enough, a patch of dark glimmer showed open water, and when they cautiously went to look, they found a canal basin where a dozen or so barges were tied up at the wharves, some high in the water, some low and laden under the gallows-like cranes.
并列句	A dim light shone in one window of a wooden hut, and a thread of smoke rose from the metal chimney; otherwise the only lights were high up on the wall of the warehouse or the gantry of a crane, leaving the ground in gloom.
陈述句	The wharves were piled with barrels of coal spirit, with stacks of great round logs, with rolls of cauchuc-covered cable.
并列句	Lyra tiptoed up to the hut and peeped in at the window.
并列句	An old man was laboriously reading a picture'Story paper and smoking a pipe, with his spaniel daemon curled up asleep on the table.
并列句	As she looked, the man got up and brought a blackened kettle from the iron stove and poured some hot water into a cracked mug before settling back with his paper.
疑问句	Should we ask him to let us in, Pan?
并列句	she whispered, but he was distracted; he was a bat, an owl, a wildcat again; she looked all round, catching his panic, and then saw them at the same time as he did: two men running at her, one from each side, the nearer holding a throwing net.
并列句	Pantalaimon uttered a harsh scream and launched himself as a leopard at the closer man's daemon, a savage-looking fox, bowling her backward and tangling with the man's legs.
并列句	The man cursed and dodged aside, and Lyra darted past him toward the open spaces of the wharf.
陈述句	What she mustn't do was get boxed in a corner.
并列句	Pantalaimon, an eagle now, swooped at her and cried, Left!
感叹句	Left!
并列句	She swerved that way and saw a gap between the coal-spirit barrels and the end of a corrugated iron shed, and darted for it like a bullet.
并列句	But those throwing nets!
并列句	She heard a hiss in the air, and past her cheek something lashed and sharply stung, and loathsome tarred strings whipped across her face, her arms, her hands, and tangled and held her, and she fell, snarling and tearing and struggling in vain.
感叹句	Pan!
感叹句	Pan!
并列句	But the fox daemon tore at the cat Pantalaimon, and Lyra felt the pain in her own flesh, and sobbed a great cry as he fell.
并列句	One man was swiftly lashing cords around her, around her limbs, her throat, body, head, bundling her over and over on the wet ground.
陈述句	She was helpless, exactly like a fly being trussed by a spider.
并列句	Poor hurt Pan was dragging himself toward her, with the fox daemon worrying his back, and he had no strength left to change, even; and the other man was lying in a puddle, with an arrow through his neck- The whole world grew still as the man tying the net saw it too.
并列句	Pantalaimon sat up and blinked, and then there was a soft thud, and the net man fell choking and gasping right across Lyra, who cried out in horror: that was blood gushing out of him!
并列句	Running feet, and someone hauled the man away and bent over him; then other hands lifted Lyra, a knife snicked and pulled and the net strings fell away one by one, and she tore them off, spitting, and hurled herself down to cuddle Pantalaimon.
陈述句	Kneeling, she twisted to look up at the newcomers.
并列句	Three dark men, one armed with a bow, the others with knives; and as she turned, the bowman caught his breath.
疑问句	That en't Lyra?
并列句	A familiar voice, but she couldn't place it till he stepped forward and the nearest light fell on his face and the hawk daemon on his shoulder.
陈述句	Then she had it.
感叹句	A gyptian!
感叹句	A real Oxford gyptian!
陈述句	Tony Costa, he said.
疑问句	Remember?
陈述句	You used to play with my little brother Billy off the boats in Jericho, afore the Gobblers got him.
感叹句	Oh, God, Pan, we're safe!
并列句	she sobbed, but then a thought rushed into her mind: it was the Costas' boat she'd hijacked that day.
疑问句	Suppose he remembered?
陈述句	Better come along with us, he said.
疑问句	You alone?
陈述句	Yeah.
陈述句	I was running away.... All right, don't talk now.
陈述句	Just keep quiet.
陈述句	Jaxer, move them bodies into the shadow.
陈述句	Kerim, look around.
陈述句	Lyra stood up shakily, holding the wildcat Pantalaimon to her breast.
并列句	He was twisting to look at something, and she followed his gaze, understanding and suddenly curious too: what had happened to the dead men's daemons?
并列句	They were fading, that was the answer; fading and drifting away like atoms of smoke, for all that they tried to cling to their men.
并列句	Pantalaimon hid his eyes, and Lyra hurried blindly after Tony Costa.
疑问句	What are you doing here?
陈述句	she said.
陈述句	Quiet, gal.
陈述句	There's enough trouble awake without stirring more.
陈述句	We'll talk on the boat.
陈述句	He led her over a little wooden bridge into the heart of the canal basin.
陈述句	The other two men were padding silently after them.
并列句	Tony turned along the waterfront and out onto a wooden jetty, from which he stepped on board a narrowboat and swung open the door to the cabin.
陈述句	Get in, he said.
陈述句	Quick now.
陈述句	Lyra did so, patting her bag (which she had never let go of, even in the net) to make sure the alethiometer was still there.
陈述句	In the long narrow cabin, by the light of a lantern on a hook, she saw a stout powerful woman with gray hair, sitting at a table with a paper.
陈述句	Lyra recognized her as Billy's mother.
疑问句	Who's this?
陈述句	the woman said.
疑问句	That's never Lyra?
陈述句	That's right.
陈述句	Ma, we got to move.
陈述句	We killed two men out in the basin.
并列句	We thought they was Gobblers, but I reckon they were Turk traders.
陈述句	They'd caught Lyra.
陈述句	Never mind talk-we'll do that on the move.
陈述句	Come here, child, said Ma Costa.
并列句	Lyra obeyed, half happy, half apprehensive, for Ma Costa had hands like bludgeons, and now she was sure: it was their boat she had captured with Roger and the other collegers.
并列句	But the boat mother set her hands on either side of Lyra's face, and her daemon, a hawk, bent gently to lick Pantalaimon's wildcat head.
并列句	Then Ma Costa folded her great arms around Lyra and pressed her to her breast.
并列句	I dunno what you're a doing here, but you look wore out.
陈述句	You can have Billy's crib, soon's I've got a hot drink in you.
陈述句	Set you down there, child.
并列句	It looked as if her piracy was forgiven, or at least forgotten.
陈述句	Lyra slid onto the cushioned bench behind a well-scrubbed pine table top as the low rumble of the gas engine shook the boat.
疑问句	Where we going?
陈述句	Lyra asked.
并列句	Ma Costa was setting a saucepan of milk on the iron stove and riddling the grate to stir the fire up.
陈述句	Away from here.
陈述句	No talking now.
陈述句	We'll talk in the morning.
并列句	And she said no more, handing Lyra a cup of milk when it was ready, swinging herself up on deck when the boat began to move, exchanging occasional whispers with the men.
并列句	Lyra sipped the milk and lifted a corner of the blind to watch the dark wharves move past.
并列句	A minute or two later she was sound asleep.
陈述句	She awoke in a narrow bed, with that comforting engine rumble deep below.
并列句	She sat up, banged her head, cursed, felt around, and got up more carefully.
并列句	A thin gray light showed her three other bunks, each empty and neatly made, one below hers and the other two across the tiny cabin.
并列句	She swung over the side to find herself in her underclothes, and saw the dress and the wolfskin coat folded at the end of her bunk together with her shopping bag.
陈述句	The alethiometer was still there.
并列句	She dressed quickly and went through the door at the end to find herself in the cabin with the stove, where it was warm.
陈述句	There was no one there.
并列句	Through the windows she saw a gray swirl of fog on each side, with occasional dark shapes that might have been buildings or trees.
并列句	Before she could go out on deck, the outer door opened and Ma Costa came down, swathed in an old tweed coat on which the damp had settled like a thousand tiny pearls.
疑问句	Sleep well?
陈述句	she said, reaching for a frying pan.
并列句	Now sit down out the way and I'll make ye some breakfast.
陈述句	Don't stand about; there en't room.
疑问句	Where are we?
陈述句	said Lyra.
陈述句	On the Grand Junction Canal.
陈述句	You keep out of sight, child.
陈述句	I don't want to see you topside.
陈述句	There's trouble.
并列句	She sliced a couple of rashers of bacon into the frying pan, and cracked an egg to go with them.
疑问句	What sort of trouble?
条件状语从句	Nothing we can't cope with, if you stay out the way.
并列句	And she wouldn't say any more till Lyra had eaten.
并列句	The boat slowed at one point, and something banged against the side, and she heard men's voices raised in anger; but then someone's joke made them laugh, and the voices drew away and the boat moved on.
陈述句	Presently Tony Costa swung down into the cabin.
并列句	Like his mother, he was pearled with damp, and he shook his woollen hat over the stove to make the drops jump and spit.
疑问句	What we going to tell her, Ma?
陈述句	Ask first, tell after.
并列句	He poured some coffee into a tin cup and sat down.
并列句	He was a powerful, dark-faced man, and now that she could see him in daylight, Lyra saw a sad grimness in his expression.
陈述句	Right, he said.
陈述句	Now you tell us what you was doing in London, Lyra.
陈述句	We had you down as being took by the Gobblers.
并列句	I was living with this lady, right... Lyra clumsily collected her story and shook it into order as if she were settling a pack of cards ready for dealing.
陈述句	She told them everything, except about the alethiometer.
并列句	And then last night at this cocktail party I found out what they were really doing.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter was one of the Gobblers herself, and she was going to use me to help her catch more kids.
并列句	And what they do is- Ma Costa left the cabin and went out to the cockpit.
并列句	Tony waited till the door was shut, and cut in: We know what they do.
陈述句	Least, we know part of it.
陈述句	We know they don't come back.
并列句	Them kids is taken up north, far out the way, and they do experiments on 'em.
并列句	At first we reckoned they tried out different diseases and medicines, but there'd be no reason to start that all of a sudden two or three years back.
原因状语从句	Then we thought about the Tartars, maybe there's some secret deal they're making up Siberia way; because the Tartars want to move north just as much as the rest, for the coal spirit and the fire mines, and there's been rumors of war for even longer than the Gobblers been going.
并列句	And we reckoned the Gobblers were buying off the Tartar chiefs by giving 'em kids, cause the Tartars eat 'em, don't they?
并列句	They bake children and eat em.
感叹句	They never!
陈述句	said Lyra.
陈述句	They do.
并列句	There's plenty of other things to be told, and all.
疑问句	You ever heard of the Nalkainens?
陈述句	Lyra said, No.
陈述句	Not even with Mrs. Coulter.
疑问句	What are they?
陈述句	That's a kind of ghost they have up there in those forests.
并列句	Same size as a child, and they got no heads.
并列句	They feel their way about at night and if you're a sleeping out in the forest they get ahold of you and won't nothing make 'em let go.
陈述句	Nalkainens, that's a northern word.
并列句	And the Windsuckers, they're dangerous too.
陈述句	They drift about in the air.
并列句	You come across clumps of 'em floated together sometimes, or caught snagged on a bramble.
陈述句	As soon as they touch you, all the strength goes out of you.
陈述句	You can't see 'em except as a kind of shimmer in the air.
并列句	And the Breathless Ones... Who are they?
陈述句	Warriors half-killed.
并列句	Being alive is one thing, and being dead's another, but being half-killed is worse than either.
并列句	They just can't die, and living is altogether beyond 'em.
陈述句	They wander about forever.
原因状语从句	They're called the Breathless Ones because of what's been done to 'em.
并列句	And what's that?
陈述句	said Lyra, wide-eyed.
并列句	The North Tartars snap open their ribs and pull out their lungs.
陈述句	There's an art to it.
并列句	They do it without killing 'em, but their lungs can't work anymore without their daemons pumping 'em by hand, so the result is they're halfway between breath and no breath, life and death, half-killed, you see.
并列句	And their daemons got to pump and pump all day and night, or else perish with 'em.
陈述句	You come across a whole platoon of Breathless Ones in the forest sometimes, I've heard.
并列句	And then there's the panserbj0rne-you heard of them?
陈述句	That means armored bears.
感叹句	They're great white bears, and- Yes!
感叹句	I have heard of them!
陈述句	One of the men last night, he said that my uncle, Lord Asriel, he's being imprisoned in a fortress guarded by the armored bears.
疑问句	Is he, now?
并列句	And what was he doing up there?
陈述句	Exploring.
并列句	But the way the man was talking I don't think my uncle's on the same side as the Gobblers.
陈述句	I think they were glad he was in prison.
条件状语从句	Well, he won't get out if the armored bears are guarding him.
疑问句	They're like mercenaries, you know what I mean by that?
陈述句	They sell their strength to whoever pays.
并列句	They got hands like men, and they learned the trick of working iron way back, meteoric iron mostly, and they make great sheets and plates of it to cover theirselves with.
陈述句	They been raiding the Skraelings for centuries.
陈述句	They're vicious killers, absolutely pitiless.
并列句	But they keep their word.
条件状语从句	If you make a bargain with a panserbj0m, you can rely on it.
陈述句	Lyra considered these horrors with awe.
原因状语从句	Ma don't like to hear about the North, Tony said after a few moments, because of what might've happened to Billy.
陈述句	We know they took him up north, see.
疑问句	How d'you know that?
并列句	We caught one of the Gobblers, and made him talk.
陈述句	That's how we know a little about what they're doing.
陈述句	Them two last night weren't Gobblers; they were too clumsy.
条件状语从句	If they'd been Gobblers we'd've took 'em alive.
并列句	See, the gyptian people, we been hit worse than most by these Gobblers, and we're a coming together to decide what to do about it.
陈述句	That's what we was doing in the basin last night, taking on stores, 'cause we're going to a big muster up in the fens, what we call a roping.
并列句	And what I reckon is we're a going to send out a rescue party, when we heard what all the other gyptians know, when we put our knowledge together.
条件状语从句	That's what I'd do, if I was John Faa.
疑问句	Who's John Faa?
陈述句	The king of the gyptians.
并列句	And you're really going to rescue the kids?
疑问句	What about Roger?
疑问句	Who's Roger?
陈述句	The Jordan College kitchen boy.
陈述句	He was took same as Billy the day before I come away with Mrs. Coulter.
并列句	I bet if I was took, he'd come and rescue me.
并列句	If you're going to rescue Billy, I want to come too and rescue Roger.
并列句	And Uncle Asriel, she thought; but she didn't mention that.
陈述句	SEVEN  JOHN FAA     Now that Lyra had a task in mind, she felt much better.
并列句	Helping Mrs. Coulter had been all very well, but Pantalaimon was right: she wasn't really doing any work there, she was just a pretty pet.
并列句	On the gyptian boat, there was real work to do, and Ma Costa made sure she did it.
并列句	She cleaned and swept, she peeled potatoes and made tea, she greased the propeller shaft bearings, she kept the weed trap clear over the propeller, she washed dishes, she opened lock gates, she tied the boat up at mooring posts, and within a couple of days she was as much at home with this new life as if she'd been born gyptian.
陈述句	What she didn't notice was that the Costas were alert every second for unusual signs of interest in Lyra from the waterside people.
并列句	If she hadn't realized it, she was important, and Mrs. Coulter and the Oblation Board were bound to be searching everywhere for her.
并列句	Indeed, Tony heard from gos-sip in pubs along the way that the police were making raids on houses and farms and building yards and factories without any explanation, though there was a rumor that they were searching for a missing girl.
并列句	And that in itself was odd, considering all the kids that had gone missing without being looked for.
并列句	Gyptians and land folk alike were getting jumpy and nervous.
并列句	And there was another reason for the Costas' interest in Lyra; but she wasn't to learn that for a few days yet.
并列句	So they took to keeping her below decks when they passed a lockkeeper's cottage or a canal basin, or anywhere there were likely to be idlers hanging about.
并列句	Once they passed through a town where the police were searching all the boats that came along the waterway, and holding up the traffic in both directions.
让步状语从句	The Costas were equal to that, though.
并列句	There was a secret compartment beneath Ma's bunk, where Lyra lay cramped for two hours while the police banged up and down the length of the boat unsuccessfully.
让步状语从句	Why didn't their daemons find me, though?
并列句	she asked afterward, and Ma showed her the lining of the secret space: cedarwood, which had a soporific effect on daemons; and it was true that Pantalaimon had spent the whole time happily asleep by Lyra's head.
并列句	Slowly, with many halts and detours, the Costas' boat drew nearer the fens, that wide and never fully mapped wilderness of huge skies and endless marshland in Eastern Anglia.
并列句	The furthest fringe of it mingled indistinguishably with the creeks and tidal inlets of the shallow sea, and the other side of the sea mingled indistinguishably with Holland; and parts of the fens had been drained and dyked by Hollanders, some of whom had settled there; so the language of the fens was thick with Dutch.
并列句	But parts had never been drained or planted or settled at all, and in the wildest central regions, where eels slithered and waterbirds flocked, where eerie marsh fires flick-ered and waylurkers tempted careless travelers to their doom in the swamps and bogs, the gyptian people had always found it safe to muster.
并列句	And now by a thousand winding channels and creeks and watercourses, gyptian boats were moving in toward the byanplats, the only patch of slightly higher ground in the hundreds of square miles of marsh and bog.
并列句	There was an ancient wooden meeting hall there with a huddle of permanent dwellings around it, and wharves and jetties and an eelmarket.
并列句	When the gyptians called a byanroping-a summons or muster of families-so many boats filled the waterways that you could walk for a mile in any direction over their decks; or so it was said.
陈述句	The gyptians ruled in the fens.
并列句	No one else dared enter, and while the gyptians kept the peace and traded fairly, the landlopers turned a blind eye to the incessant smuggling and the occasional feuds.
并列句	If a gyptian body floated ashore down the coast, or got snagged in a fishnet, well-it was only a gyptian.
并列句	Lyra listened enthralled to tales of the fen dwellers, of the great ghost dog Black Shuck, of the marsh fires arising from bubbles of witch oil, and began to think of herself as gyptian even before they reached the fens.
并列句	She had soon slipped back into her Oxford voice, and now she was acquiring a gyptian one, complete with Fen-Dutch words.
陈述句	Ma Costa had to remind her of a few things.
陈述句	You en't gyptian, Lyra.
并列句	You might pass for gyptian with practice, but there's more to us than gyptian language.
并列句	There's deeps in us and strong currents.
并列句	We're water people all through, and you en't, you're a fire person.
陈述句	What you're most like is marsh fire, that's the place you have in the gyptian scheme; you got witch oil in your soul.
陈述句	Deceptive, that's what you are, child.
陈述句	Lyra was hurt.
感叹句	I en't never deceived anyone!
陈述句	You ask...
并列句	There was no one to ask, of course, and Ma Costa laughed, but kindly.
疑问句	Can't you see I'm a paying you a compliment, you gosling?
并列句	she said, and Lyra was pacified, though she didn't understand.
并列句	When they reached the byanplats it was evening, and the sun was about to set in a splash of bloody sky.
并列句	The low island and the Zaal were humped blackly against the light, like the clustered buildings around; threads of smoke rose into the still air, and from the press of boats all around came the smells of frying fish, of smokeleaf, of jenniver spirit.
陈述句	They tied up close to the Zaal itself, at a mooring Tony said had been used by their family for generations.
并列句	Presently Ma Costa had the frying pan going, with a couple of fat eels hissing and sputtering and the kettle on for potato powder.
并列句	Tony and Kerim oiled their hair, put on their finest leather jackets and blue spotted neckerchiefs, loaded their fingers with silver rings, and went to greet some old friends in the neighboring boats and drink a glass or two in the nearest bar.
陈述句	They came back with important news.
陈述句	We got here just in time.
陈述句	The Roping's this very night.
并列句	And they're a saying in the town-what d'you think of this?- they're saying that the missing child's on a gyptian boat, and she's a going to appear tonight at the Roping!
并列句	He laughed loudly and ruffled Lyra's hair.
并列句	Ever since they'd entered the fens he had been more and more good tempered, as if the savage gloom his face showed outside were only a disguise.
并列句	And Lyra felt an excitement growing in her breast as she ate quickly and washed the dishes before combing her hair, tucking the alethiometer into the wolfskin coat pocket, and jumping ashore with all the other families making their way up the slope to the Zaal.
陈述句	She had thought Tony was joking.
并列句	She soon found that he wasn't, or else that she looked less like a gyptian than she'd thought, for many people stared, and children pointed, and by the time they reached the great doors of the Zaal they were walking alone between a crowd on either side, who had fallen back to stare and give them room.
并列句	And then Lyra began to feel truly nervous.
并列句	She kept close to Ma Costa, and Pantalaimon became as big as he could and took his panther shape to reassure her.
并列句	Ma Costa trudged up the steps as if nothing in the world could possibly either stop her or make her go more quickly, and Tony and Kerim walked proudly on either side like princes.
并列句	The hall was lit by naphtha lamps, which shone brightly enough on the faces and bodies of the audience, but left the lofty rafters hidden in darkness.
并列句	The people coming in had to struggle to find room on the floor, where the benches were already crowded; but families squeezed up to make space, children occupying laps and daemons curling up underfoot or perching out of the way on the rough wooden walls.
陈述句	At the front of the Zaal there was a platform with eight carved wooden chairs set out.
并列句	As Lyra and the Costas found space to stand along the edge of the hall, eight men appeared from the shadows at the rear of the platform and stood in front of the chairs.
并列句	A ripple of excitement swept over the audience as they hushed one another and shoved themselves into spaces on the nearest bench.
并列句	Finally there was silence and seven of the men on the platform sat down.
并列句	The one who remained was in his seventies, but tall and bull necked and powerful.
并列句	He wore a plain canvas jacket and a checked shirt, like many gyptian men; there was nothing to mark him out but the air of strength and authority he had.
并列句	Lyra recognized it: Uncle Asriel had it, and so did the Master of Jordan.
陈述句	This man's daemon was a crow, very like the Master's raven.
陈述句	That's John Faa, the lord of the western gyptians, Tony whispered.
陈述句	John Faa began to speak, in a deep slow voice.
感叹句	Gyptians!
陈述句	Welcome to the Roping.
并列句	We've come to listen and come to decide.
陈述句	You all know why.
陈述句	There are many families here who've lost a child.
陈述句	Some have lost two.
陈述句	Someone is taking them.
陈述句	To be sure, landlopers are losing children too.
陈述句	We have no quarrel with landlopers over this.
并列句	Now there's been talk about a child and a reward.
陈述句	Here's the truth to stop all gossip.
并列句	The child's name is Lyra Belacqua, and she's being sought by the landloper police.
陈述句	There is a reward of one thousand sovereigns for giving her up to them.
并列句	She's a landloper child, and she's in our care, and there she's going to stay.
陈述句	Anyone tempted by those thousand sovereigns had better find a place neither on land nor on water.
陈述句	We en't giving her up.
陈述句	Lyra felt a blush from the roots of her hair to the soles of her feet; Pantalaimon became a brown moth to hide.
并列句	Eyes all around were turning to them, and she could only look up at Ma Costa for reassurance.
并列句	But John Faa was speaking again: Talk all we may, we won't change owt.
条件状语从句	We must act if we want to change things.
陈述句	Here's another fact for you: the Gobblers, these child thieves, are a taking their prisoners to a town in the far North, way up in the land of dark.
陈述句	I don't know what they do with 'em there.
陈述句	Some folk say they kill 'em, other folk say different.
陈述句	We don't know.
并列句	What we do know is that they do it with the help of the landloper police and the clergy.
陈述句	Every power on land is helping 'em.
陈述句	Remember that.
并列句	They know what's going on and they'll help it whenever they can.
陈述句	So what I'm proposing en't easy.
并列句	And I need your agreement.
并列句	I'm proposing that we send a band of fighters up north to rescue them kids and bring 'em back alive.
并列句	I'm proposing that we put our gold into this, and all the craft and courage we can muster.
疑问句	Yes, Raymond van Gerrit?
并列句	A man in the audience had raised his hand, and John Faa sat down to let him speak.
陈述句	Beg pardon, Lord Faa.
陈述句	There's landloper kids as well as gyptians been taken captive.
疑问句	Are you saying we should rescue them as well?
陈述句	John Faa stood up to answer.
并列句	Raymond, are you saying we should fight our way through every kind of danger to a little group of frightened children, and then say to some of them that they can come home, and to the rest that they have to stay?
陈述句	No, you're a better man than that.
疑问句	Well, do I have your approval, my friends?
并列句	The question caught them by surprise, for there was a moment's hesitation; but then a full-throated roar filled the hall, and hands were clapped in the air, fists shaken, voices raised in excited clamor.
并列句	The rafters of the Zaal shook, and from their perches up in the dark a score of sleeping birds woke up in fear and flapped their wings, and little showers of dust drifted down.
并列句	John Faa let the noise continue for a minute, and then raised his hand for silence again.
陈述句	This'll take a while to organize.
并列句	I want the heads of the families to raise a tax and muster a levy.
陈述句	We'll meet again here in three days' time.
并列句	In between now and then I'm a going to talk with the child I mentioned before, and with Farder Coram, and form a plan to put before you when we meet.
陈述句	Goodnight to ye all.
陈述句	His massive, plain, blunt presence was enough to calm them.
并列句	As the audience began to move out of the great doors into the chilly evening, to go to their boats or to the crowded bars of the little settlement, Lyra said to Ma Costa: Who are the other men on the platform?
并列句	The heads of the six families, and the other man is Farder Coram.
原因状语从句	It was easy to see who she meant by the other man, because he was the oldest one there.
并列句	He walked with a stick, and all the time he'd been sitting behind John Faa he'd been trembling as if with an ague.
陈述句	Come on, said Tony.
陈述句	I'd best take you up to pay your respects to John Faa.
陈述句	You call him Lord Faa.
并列句	I don't know what you'll be asked, but mind you tell the truth.
并列句	Pantalaimon was a sparrow now, and sat curiously on Lyra's shoulder, his claws deep in the wolfskin coat, as she followed Tony through the crowd up to the platform.
陈述句	He lifted her up.
并列句	Knowing that everyone still in the hall was staring at her, and conscious of those thousand sovereigns she was suddenly worth, she blushed and hesitated.
并列句	Pantalaimon darted to her breast and became a wildcat, sitting up in her arms and hissing softly as he looked around.
并列句	Lyra felt a push, and stepped forward to John Faa.
并列句	He was stern and massive and expressionless, more like a pillar of rock than a man, but he stooped and held out his hand to shake.
陈述句	When she put hers in, it nearly vanished.
陈述句	Welcome, Lyra, he said.
陈述句	Close to, she felt his voice rumbling like the earth itself.
并列句	She would have been nervous but for Pantalaimon, and the fact that John Faa's stony expression had warmed a little.
陈述句	He was treating her very gently.
陈述句	Thank you, Lord Faa, she said.
并列句	Now you come in the parley room and we'll have a talk, said John Faa.
疑问句	Have they been feeding you proper, the Costas?
陈述句	Oh, yes.
陈述句	We had eels for supper.
陈述句	Proper fen eels, I expect.
并列句	The parley room was a comfortable place with a big fire, sideboards laden with silver and porcelain, and a heavy table darkly polished by the years, at which twelve chairs were drawn up.
并列句	The other men from the platform had gone elsewhere, but the old shaking man was still with them.
陈述句	John Faa helped him to a seat at the table.
并列句	Now, you sit here on my right, John Faa said to Lyra, and took the chair at the head of the table himself.
陈述句	Lyra found herself opposite Farder Coram.
并列句	She was a little frightened by his skull-like face and his continual trembling.
并列句	His daemon was a beautiful autumn-colored cat, massive in size, who stalked along the table with upraised tail and elegantly inspected Pantalaimon, touching noses briefly before settling on Farder Coram's lap, half-closing her eyes and purring softly.
并列句	A woman whom Lyra hadn't noticed came out of the shadows with a tray of glasses, set it down by John Faa, curtsied, and left.
并列句	John Faa poured little glasses of jenniver from a stone crock for himself and Farder Coram, and wine for Lyra.
陈述句	So, John Faa said.
陈述句	You run away, Lyra.
陈述句	Yes.
并列句	And who was the lady you run away from?
陈述句	She was called Mrs. Coulter.
并列句	And I thought she was nice, but I found out she was one of the Gobblers.
并列句	I heard someone say what the Gobblers were, they were called the General Oblation Board, and she was in charge of it, it was all her idea.
并列句	And they was all working on some plan, I dunno what it was, only they was going to make me help her get kids for 'em.
并列句	But they never knew...
疑问句	They never knew what?
陈述句	Well, first they never knew that I knew some kids what had been took.
并列句	My friend Roger the kitchen boy from Jordan College, and Billy Costa, and a girl out the covered market in Oxford.
并列句	And another thing...My uncle, right, Lord Asriel.
并列句	1 heard them talking about his journeys to the North, and I don't reckon he's got anything to do with the Gobblers.
原因状语从句	Because I spied on the Master and the Scholars of Jordan, right, I hid in the Retiring Room where no one's supposed to go except them, and I heard him tell them all about his expedition up north, and the Dust he saw, and he brought back the head of Stanislaus Grumman, what the Tartars had made a hole in.
并列句	And now the Gobblers've got him locked up somewhere.
陈述句	The armored bears are guarding him.
并列句	And I want to rescue him.
并列句	She looked fierce and stubborn as she sat there, small against the high carved back of the chair.
并列句	The two old men couldn't help smiling, but whereas Farder Coram's smile was a hesitant, rich, complicated expression that trembled across his face like sunlight chasing shadows on a windy March day, John Faa's smile was slow, warm, plain, and kindly.
陈述句	You better tell us what you did hear your uncle say that evening, said John Faa.
陈述句	Don't leave anything out, mind.
陈述句	Tell us everything.
并列句	Lyra did, more slowly than she'd told the Costas but more honestly, too.
并列句	She was afraid of John Faa, and what she was most afraid of was his kindness.
陈述句	When she'd finished, Farder Coram spoke for the first time.
并列句	His voice was rich and musical, with as many tones in it as there were colors in his daemon's fur.
陈述句	This Dust, he said.
疑问句	Did they ever call it anything else, Lyra?
陈述句	No.
陈述句	Just Dust.
并列句	Mrs. Coulter told me what it was, elementary particles, but that's all she called it.
并列句	And they think that by doing something to children, they can find out more about it?
陈述句	Yes.
并列句	But I don't know what.
陈述句	Except my uncle...There's something I forgot to tell you.
陈述句	When he was showing them lantern slides, there was another one he had.
疑问句	It was the Roarer- The what?
陈述句	said John Faa.
陈述句	The Aurora, said Farder Coram.
疑问句	Is that right, Lyra?
陈述句	Yeah, that's it.
并列句	And in the lights of the Roarer there was like a city.
并列句	All towers and churches and domes and that.
陈述句	It was a bit like Oxford, that's what I thought, anyway.
并列句	And Uncle Asriel, he was more interested in that, I think, but the Master and the other Scholars were more interested in Dust, like Mrs. Coulter and Lord Boreal and them.
陈述句	I see, said Farder Coram.
陈述句	That's very interesting.
陈述句	Now, Lyra, said John Faa, I'm a going to tell you something.
陈述句	Farder Coram here, he's a wise man.
陈述句	He's a seer.
并列句	He's been a follering all what's been going on with Dust and the Gobblers and Lord Asriel and everything else, and he's been a follering you.
并列句	Every time the Costas went to Oxford, or half a dozen other families, come to that, they brought back a bit of news.
陈述句	About you, child.
疑问句	Did you know that?
陈述句	Lyra shook her head.
陈述句	She was beginning to be frightened.
并列句	Pantalaimon was growling too deep for anyone to hear, but she could feel it in her fingertips down inside his fur.
陈述句	Oh, yes, said John Faa, all your doings, they all get back to Farder Coram here.
陈述句	Lyra couldn't hold it in.
感叹句	We didn't damage it!
感叹句	Honest!
感叹句	It was only a bit of mud!
并列句	And we never got very far- What are you talking about, child?
陈述句	said John Faa.
陈述句	Farder Coram laughed.
并列句	When he did that, his shaking stopped and his face became bright and young.
并列句	But Lyra wasn't laughing.
并列句	With trembling lips she said, And even if we had found the bung, we'd never've took it out!
陈述句	It was just a joke.
感叹句	We wouldn't've sunk it, never!
陈述句	Then John Faa began to laugh too.
并列句	He slapped a broad hand on the table so hard the glasses rang, and his massive shoulders shook, and he had to wipe away the tears from his eyes.
陈述句	Lyra had never seen such a sight, never heard such a bellow; it was like a mountain laughing.
感叹句	Oh, yes, he said when he could speak again, we heard about that too, little girl!
陈述句	I don't suppose the Costas have set foot anywhere since then without being reminded of it.
陈述句	You better leave a guard on your boat, Tony, people say.
感叹句	Fierce little girls round here!
陈述句	Oh, that story went all over the fens, child.
并列句	But we en't going to punish you for it.
感叹句	No, no!
陈述句	Ease your mind.
并列句	He looked at Farder Coram, and the two old men laughed again, but more gently.
并列句	And Lyra felt contented, and safe.
并列句	Finally John Faa shook his head and became serious again.
陈述句	I were saying, Lyra, as we knew about you from a child.
陈述句	From a baby.
陈述句	You oughter know what we know.
并列句	I can't guess what they told you at Jordan College about where you came from, but they don't know the whole truth of it.
疑问句	Did they ever tell you who your parents were?
陈述句	Now Lyra was completely dazed.
陈述句	Yes, she said.
原因状语从句	They said I was-they said they-they said Lord Asriel put me there because my mother and father died in an airship accident.
陈述句	That's what they told me.
陈述句	Ah, did they.
陈述句	Well now, child, I'm a going to tell you a story, a true story.
原因状语从句	I know it's true, because a gyptian woman told me, and they all tell the truth to John Faa and Farder Coram.
陈述句	So this is the truth about yourself, Lyra.
原因状语从句	Your father never perished in no airship accident, because your father is Lord Asriel.
陈述句	Lyra could only sit in wonder.
陈述句	Here's how it came about, John Faa went on.
并列句	When he was a young man, Lord Asriel went exploring all over the North, and came back with a great fortune.
并列句	And he was a high-spirited man, quick to anger, a passionate man.
并列句	And your mother, she was passionate too.
并列句	Not so well born as him, but a clever woman.
并列句	A Scholar, even, and those who saw her said she was very beautiful.
并列句	She and your father, they fell in love as soon's they met.
陈述句	The trouble was, your mother was already married.
陈述句	She'd married a politician.
陈述句	He was a member of the king's party, one of his closest advisers.
陈述句	A rising man.
陈述句	Now when your mother found herself with child, she feared to tell her husband the child wasn't his.
并列句	And when the baby was born-that's you, girl-it was clear from the look of you that you didn't favor her husband, but your true father, and she thought it best to hide you away and give out that you'd died.
并列句	So you was took to Oxfordshire, where your father had estates, and put in the care of a gyptian woman to nurse.
并列句	But someone whispered to your mother's husband what had happened, and he came a flying down and ransacked the cottage where the gyptian woman had been, only she'd fled to the great house; and the husband followed after, in a murderous passion.
并列句	Lord Asriel was out a hunting, but they got word to him and he came riding back in time to find your mother's husband at the foot of the great staircase.
并列句	Another moment and he'd have forced open the closet where the gyptian woman was hiding with you, but Lord Asriel challenged him, and they fought there and then, and Lord Asriel killed him.
并列句	The gyptian woman heard and saw it all, Lyra, and that's how we know.
陈述句	The consequence was a great lawsuit.
并列句	Your father en't the kind of man to deny or conceal the truth, and it left the judges with a problem.
并列句	He'd killed all right, he'd shed blood, but he was defending his home and his child against an intruder.
并列句	On t'other hand, the law allows any man to avenge the violation of his wife, and the dead man's lawyers argued that he were doing just that.
并列句	The case lasted for weeks, with volumes of argument back and forth.
并列句	In the end the judges punished Lord Asriel by confiscating all his property and all his land, and left him a poor man; and he had been richer than a king.
陈述句	As for your mother, she wanted nothing to do with it, nor with you.
陈述句	She turned her back.
原因状语从句	The gyptian nurse told me she'd often been afeared of how your mother would treat you, because she was a proud and scornful woman.
陈述句	So much for her.
陈述句	Then there was you.
原因状语从句	If things had fallen out different, Lyra, you might have been brought up a gyptian, because the nurse begged the court to let her have you; but we gyptians got little standing in the law.
并列句	The court decided you was to be placed in a priory, and so you were, with the Sisters of Obedience at Watlington.
陈述句	You won't remember.
并列句	But Lord Asriel wouldn't stand for that.
并列句	He had a hatred of priors and monks and nuns, and being a high-handed man he just rode in one day and carried you off.
并列句	Not to look after himself, nor to give to the gyptians; he took you to Jordan College, and dared the law to undo it.
陈述句	Well, the law let things be.
并列句	Lord Asriel went back to his explorations, and you grew up at Jordan College.
陈述句	The one thing he said, your father, the one condition he made, was that your mother shouldn't be let see you.
原因状语从句	If she ever tried to do that, she was to be prevented, and he was to be told, because all the anger in his nature had turned against her now.
并列句	The Master promised faithfully to do that; and so time passed.
陈述句	Then come all this anxiety about Dust.
并列句	And all over the country, all over the world, wise men and women too began a worrying about it.
陈述句	It weren't of any account to us gyptians, until they started taking our kids.
陈述句	That's when we got interested.
并列句	And we got connections in all sorts of places you wouldn't imagine, including Jordan College.
并列句	You wouldn't know, but there's been someone a watching over you and reporting to us ever since you been there.
并列句	'Cause we got an interest in you, and that gyptian woman who nursed you, she never stopped being anxious on your behalf.
疑问句	Who was it watching over me?
陈述句	said Lyra.
并列句	She felt immensely important and strange, that all her doings should be an object of concern so far away.
陈述句	It was a kitchen servant.
陈述句	It was Bernie Johansen, the pastry cook.
陈述句	He's half-gyptian; you never knew that, I'll be bound.
陈述句	Bernie was a kindly, solitary man, one of those rare people whose daemon was the same sex as himself.
陈述句	It was Bernie she'd shouted at in her despair when Roger was taken.
并列句	And Bernie had been telling the gyptians everything!
陈述句	She marveled.
并列句	So anyway, John Faa went on, we heard about you going away from Jordan College, and how it came about at a time when Lord Asriel was imprisoned and couldn't prevent it.
并列句	And we remembered what he'd said to the Master that he must never do, and we remembered that the man your mother had married, the politician Lord Asriel killed, was called Edward Coulter.
疑问句	Mrs. Coulter?
陈述句	said Lyra, quite stupefied.
疑问句	She en't my mother?
陈述句	She is.
并列句	And if your father had been free, she wouldn't never have dared to defy him, and you'd still be at Jordan, not knowing a thing.
并列句	But what the Master was a doing letting you go is a mystery I can't explain.
陈述句	He was charged with your care.
陈述句	All I can guess is that she had some power over him.
陈述句	Lyra suddenly understood the Master's curious behavior on the morning she'd left.
并列句	But he didn't want to... she said, trying to remember it exactly.
并列句	He...I had to go and see him first thing that morning, and I mustn't tell Mrs.
并列句	Coulter....It was like he wanted to protect me from her... She stopped, and looked at the two men carefully, and then decided to tell them the whole truth about the Retiring Room.
陈述句	See, there was something else.
陈述句	That evening I hid in the Retiring Room, I saw the Master try to poison Lord Asriel.
并列句	I saw him put some powder in the wine and I told my uncle and he knocked the decanter off the table and spilled it.
陈述句	So I saved his life.
原因状语从句	I could never understand why the Master would want to poison him, because he was always so kind.
并列句	Then on the morning I left he called me in early to his study, and I had to go secretly so no one would know, and he said... Lyra racked her brains to try and remember exactly what it was the Master had said.
陈述句	No good; she shook her head.
并列句	The only thing I could understand was that he gave me something and I had to keep it secret from her, from Mrs. Coulter.
并列句	I suppose it's all right if I tell you.... She felt in the pocket of the wolfskin coat and took out the velvet package.
并列句	She laid it on the table, and she sensed John Faa's massive simple curiosity and Farder Coram's bright flickering intelligence both trained on it like searchlights.
陈述句	When she laid the alethiometer bare, it was Farder Coram who spoke first.
陈述句	I never thought I'd ever set eyes on one of them again.
陈述句	That's a symbol reader.
疑问句	Did he tell you anything about it, child?
陈述句	No.
陈述句	Only that I'd have to work out how to read it by myself.
并列句	And he called it an alethiometer.
疑问句	What's that mean?
陈述句	said John Faa, turning to his companion.
陈述句	That's a Greek word.
陈述句	I reckon it's from aktheia, which means truth.
陈述句	It's a truth measure.
并列句	And have you worked out how to use it?
陈述句	he said to her.
陈述句	No.
并列句	Least, I can make the three short hands point to different pictures, but I can't do anything with the long one.
陈述句	It goes all over.
并列句	Except sometimes, right, sometimes when I'm sort of concentrating, I can make the long needle go this way or that just by thinking it.
疑问句	What's it do, Farder Coram?
陈述句	said John Faa.
并列句	And how do you read it?
并列句	All these pictures round the rim, said Farder Coram, holding it delicately toward John Faa's blunt strong gaze, they're symbols, and each one stands for a whole series of things.
陈述句	Take the anchor, there.
原因状语从句	The first meaning of that is hope, because hope holds you fast like an anchor so you don't give way.
陈述句	The second meaning is steadfastness.
并列句	The third meaning is snag, or prevention.
陈述句	The fourth meaning is the sea.
并列句	And so on, down to ten, twelve, maybe a never-ending series of meanings.
并列句	And do you know them all?
并列句	I know some, but to read it fully I'd need the book.
并列句	I seen the book and I know where it is, but I en't got it.
陈述句	We'll come back to that, said John Faa.
陈述句	Go on with how you read it.
并列句	You got three hands you can control, Farder Coram explained, and you use them to ask a question.
原因状语从句	By pointing to three symbols you can ask any question you can imagine, because you've got so many levels of each one.
并列句	Once you got your question framed, the other needle swings round and points to more symbols that give you the answer.
并列句	But how does it know what level you're a thinking of when you set the question?
陈述句	said John Faa.
陈述句	Ah, by itself it don't.
条件状语从句	It only works if the questioner holds the levels in their mind.
并列句	You got to know all the meanings, first, and there must be a thousand or more.
并列句	Then you got to be able to hold 'em in your mind without fretting at it or pushing for an answer, and just watch while the needle wanders.
陈述句	When it's gone round its full range, you'll know what the answer is.
原因状语从句	I know how it works because I seen it done once by a wise man in Uppsala, and that's the only time I ever saw one before.
疑问句	Do you know how rare these are?
陈述句	The Master told me there was only six made, Lyra said.
陈述句	Whatever the number, it en't large.
并列句	And you kept this secret from Mrs. Coulter, like the Master told you?
陈述句	said John Faa.
陈述句	Yes.
并列句	But her daemon, right, he used to go in my room.
并列句	And I'm sure he found it.
陈述句	I see.
并列句	Well, Lyra, I don't know if we'll ever understand the full truth, but this is my guess, as good as I can make it.
并列句	The Master was given a charge by Lord Asriel to look after you and keep you safe from your mother.
并列句	And that was what he did, for ten years or more.
并列句	Then Mrs. Coulter's friends in the Church helped her set up this Oblation Board, for what purpose we don't know, and there she was, as powerful in her way as Lord Asriel was in his.
并列句	Your parents, both strong in the world, both ambitious, and the Master of Jordan holding you in the balance between them.
陈述句	Now the Master's got a hundred things to look after.
并列句	His first concern is his College and the scholarship there.
条件状语从句	So if he sees a threat to that, he has to move agin it.
并列句	And the Church in recent times, Lyra, it's been a getting more commanding.
并列句	There's councils for this and councils for that; there's talk of reviving the Office of Inquisition, God forbid.
并列句	And the Master has to tread warily between all these powers.
并列句	He has to keep Jordan College on the right side of the Church, or it won't survive.
并列句	And another concern of the Master is you, child.
陈述句	Bernie Johansen was always clear about that.
并列句	The Master of Jordan and the other Scholars, they loved you like their own child.
原因状语从句	They'd do anything to keep you safe, not just because they'd promised to Lord Asriel that they would, but for your own sake.
条件状语从句	So if the Master gave you up to Mrs. Coulter when he'd promised Lord Asriel he wouldn't, he must have thought you'd be safer with her than in Jordan College, in spite of all appearances.
并列句	And when he set out to poison Lord Asriel, he must have thought that what Lord Asriel was a doing would place all of them in danger, and maybe all of us, too; maybe all the world.
并列句	I see the Master as a man having terrible choices to make; whatever he chooses will do harm, but maybe if he does the right thing, a little less harm will come about than if he chooses wrong.
陈述句	God preserve me from having to make that sort of choice.
并列句	And when it come to the point where he had to let you go, he gave you the symbol reader and bade you keep it safe.
陈述句	I wonder what he had in mind for you to do with it; as you couldn't read it, I'm foxed as to what he was a thinking.
陈述句	He said Uncle Asriel presented the alethiometer to Jordan College years before, Lyra said, struggling to remember.
并列句	He was going to say something else, and then someone knocked at the door and he had to stop.
陈述句	What I thought was, he might have wanted me to keep it away from Lord Asriel too.
并列句	Or even the opposite, said John Faa.
疑问句	What d'you mean, John?
陈述句	said Farder Coram.
陈述句	He might have had it in mind to ask Lyra to return it to Lord Asriel, as a kind of recompense for trying to poison him.
陈述句	He might have thought the danger from Lord Asriel had passed.
并列句	Or that Lord Asriel could read some wisdom from this instrument and hold back from his purpose.
条件状语从句	If Lord Asriel's held captive now, it might help set him free.
并列句	Well, Lyra, you better take this symbol reader and keep it safe.
条件状语从句	If you kept it safe so far, I en't worried about leaving it with you.
并列句	But there might come a time when we need to consult it, and I reckon we'll ask for it then.
并列句	He folded the velvet over it and slid it back across the table.
并列句	Lyra wanted to ask all kinds of questions, but suddenly she felt shy of this massive man, with his little eyes so sharp and kindly among their folds and wrinkles.
让步状语从句	One thing she had to ask, though.
疑问句	Who was the gyptian woman who nursed me ?
陈述句	Why, it was Billy Costa's mother, of course.
原因状语从句	She won't have told you, because I en't let her, but she knows what we're a talking of here, so it's all out in the open.
陈述句	Now you best be getting back to her.
陈述句	You got plenty to be a thinking of, child.
并列句	When three days is gone past, we'll have another roping and discuss all there is to do.
陈述句	You be a good girl.
陈述句	Goodnight, Lyra.
陈述句	Goodnight, Lord Faa.
并列句	Goodnight, Farder Coram, she said politely, clutching the alethiometer to her breast with one hand and scooping up Pantalaimon with the other.
陈述句	Both old men smiled kindly at her.
并列句	Outside the door of the parley room Ma Costa was waiting, and as if nothing had happened since Lyra was born, the boat mother gathered her into her great arms and kissed her before bearing her off to bed.
并列句	EIGHT  FRUSTRATION     Lyra had to adjust to her new sense of her own story, and that couldn't be done in a day.
并列句	To see Lord Asriel as her father was one thing, but to accept Mrs. Coulter as her mother was nowhere near so easy.
并列句	A couple of months ago she would have rejoiced, of course, and she knew that too, and felt confused.
并列句	But, being Lyra, she didn't fret about it for long, for there was the fen town to explore and many gyptian children to amaze.
并列句	Before the three days were up she was an expert with a punt (in her eyes, at least) and she'd gathered a gang of urchins about her with tales of her mighty father, so unjustly made captive.
并列句	And then one evening the Turkish Ambassador was a guest at Jordan for dinner.
并列句	And he was under orders from the Sultan hisself to kill my father, right, and he had a ring on his finger with a hollow stone full of poison.
并列句	And when the wine come round he made as if to reach across my father's glass, and he sprinkled the poison in.
疑问句	It was done so quick that no one else saw him, but- What sort of poison?
陈述句	demanded a thin-faced girl.
并列句	Poison out of a special Turkish serpent, Lyra invented, what they catch by playing a pipe to lure out and then they throw it a sponge soaked in honey and the serpent bites it and can't get his fangs free, and they catch it and milk the venom out of it.
并列句	Anyway, my father seen what the Turk done, and he says, Gentlemen, I want to propose a toast of friendship between Jordan College and the College of Izmir, which was the college the Turkish Ambassador belonged to.
并列句	And to show our willingness to be friends, he says, we'll swap glasses and drink each other's wine.
原因状语从句	And the Ambassador was in a fix then, 'cause he couldn't refuse to drink without giving deadly insult, and he couldn't drink it because he knew it was poisoned.
并列句	He went pale and he fainted right away at the table.
并列句	And when he come round they was all still sitting there, waiting and looking at him.
并列句	And then he had to either drink the poison or own up.
疑问句	So what did he do?
陈述句	He drunk it.
并列句	It took him five whole minutes to die, and he was in torment all the time.
疑问句	Did you see it happen?
陈述句	No, 'cause girls en't allowed at the High Table.
并列句	But I seen his body afterwards when they laid him out.
并列句	His skin was all withered like an old apple, and his eyes were starting from his head.
并列句	In fact, they had to push 'em back in the sockets.... And so on.
并列句	Meanwhile, around the edges of the fen country, the police were knocking at doors, searching attics and outhouses, inspecting papers and interrogating everyone who claimed to have seen a blond little girl; and in Oxford the search was even fiercer.
并列句	Jordan College was scoured from the dustiest boxroom to the darkest cellar, and so were Gabriel and St. Michael's, till the heads of all the colleges issued a joint protest asserting their ancient rights.
陈述句	The only notion Lyra had of the search for her was the incessant drone of the gas engines of airships crisscrossing the skies.
原因状语从句	They weren't visible, because the clouds were low and by statute airships had to keep a certain height above fen country, but who knew what cunning spy devices they might carry?
并列句	Best to keep under cover when she heard them, or wear the oilskin sou'wester over her bright distinctive hair.
并列句	And she questioned Ma Costa about every detail of the story of her birth.
并列句	She wove the details into a mental tapestry even clearer and sharper than the stories she made up, and lived over and over again the flight from the cottage, the concealment in the closet, the harsh-voiced challenge, the clash of swords- Swords?
疑问句	Great God, girl, you dreaming?
陈述句	Ma Costa said.
并列句	Mr. Coulter had a gun, and Lord Asriel knocked it out his hand and struck him down with one blow.
陈述句	Then there was two shots.
陈述句	I wonder you don't remember; you ought to, little as you were.
并列句	The first shot was Edward Coulter, who reached his gun and fired, and the second was Lord Asriel, who tore it out his grasp a second time and turned it on him.
并列句	Shot him right between the eyes and dashed his brains out.
原因状语从句	Then he says cool as paint, 'Come out, Mrs. Costa, and bring the baby,' because you were setting up such a howl, you and that daemon both; and he took you up and dandled you and sat you on his shoulders, walking up and down in high good humor with the dead man at his feet, and called for wine and bade me swab the floor.
并列句	By the end of the fourth repetition of the story Lyra was perfectly convinced she did remember it, and even volunteered details of the color of Mr. Coulter's coat and the cloaks and furs hanging in the closet.
陈述句	Ma Costa laughed.
并列句	And whenever she was alone, Lyra took out the alethiome-ter and pored over it like a lover with a picture of the beloved.
疑问句	So each image had several meanings, did it?
疑问句	Why shouldn't she work them out?
疑问句	Wasn't she Lord Asriel's daughter?
并列句	Remembering what Farder Coram had said, she tried to focus her mind on three symbols taken at random, and clicked the hands round to point at them, and found that if she held the alethiometer just so in her palms and gazed at it in a particular lazy way, as she thought of it, the long needle would begin to move more purposefully.
陈述句	Instead of its wayward divagations around the dial it swung smoothly from one picture to another.
并列句	Sometimes it would pause at three, sometimes two, sometimes five or more, and although she understood nothing of it, she gained a deep calm enjoyment from it, unlike anything she'd known.
并列句	Pantalaimon would crouch over the dial, sometimes as a cat, sometimes as a mouse, swinging his head round after the needle; and once or twice the two of them shared a glimpse of meaning that felt as if a shaft of sunlight had struck through clouds to light up a majestic line of great hills in the distance-something far beyond, and never suspected.
并列句	And Lyra thrilled at those times with the same deep thrill she'd felt all her life on hearing the word North.
并列句	So the three days passed, with much coming and going between the multitude of boats and the Zaal.
并列句	And then came the evening of the second roping.
条件状语从句	The hall was more crowded than before, if that was possible.
并列句	Lyra and the Costas got there in time to sit at the front, and as soon as the flickering lights showed that the place was crammed, John Faa and Farder Coram came out on the platform and sat behind the table.
并列句	John Faa didn't have to make a sign for silence; he just put his great hands flat on the table and looked at the people below, and the hubbub died.
陈述句	Well, he said, you done what I asked.
并列句	And better than I hoped.
并列句	I'm a going to call on the heads of the six families now to come up here and give over their gold and recount their promises.
陈述句	Nicholas Rokeby, you come first.
并列句	A stout black-bearded man climbed onto the platform and laid a heavy leather bag on the table.
陈述句	That's our gold, he said.
并列句	And we offer thirty-eight men.
陈述句	Thank you, Nicholas, said John Faa.
陈述句	Farder Coram was making a note.
并列句	The first man stood at the back of the platform as John Faa called for the next, and the next, and each came up, laid a bag on the table, and announced the number of men he could muster.
并列句	The Costas were part of the Stefanski family, and naturally Tony had been one of the first to volunteer.
并列句	Lyra noticed his hawk daemon shifting from foot to foot and spreading her wings as the Stefanski money and the promise of twenty-three men were laid before John Faa.
陈述句	When the six family heads had all come up, Farder Coram showed his piece of paper to John Faa, who stood up to address the audience again.
并列句	Friends, that's a muster of one hundred and seventy men.
陈述句	I thank you proudly.
并列句	As for the gold, I make no doubt from the weight of it that you've all dug deep in your coffers, and my warm thanks go out for that as well.
陈述句	What we're a going to do next is this.
并列句	We're a going to charter a ship and sail north, and find them kids and set 'em free.
陈述句	From what we know, there might be some fighting to do.
并列句	It won't be the first time, nor it won't be the last, but we never had to fight yet with people who kidnap children, and we shall have to be uncommon cunning.
并列句	But we en't going to come back without our kids.
疑问句	Yes, Dirk Vries?
并列句	A man stood up and said, Lord Faa, do you know why they captured them kids?
陈述句	We heard it's a theological matter.
并列句	They're making an experiment, but what nature it is we don't know.
陈述句	To tell you all the truth, we don't even know whether any harm is a coming to 'em.
并列句	But whatever it is, good or bad, they got no right to reach out by night and pluck little children out the hearts of their families.
疑问句	Yes, Raymond van Gerrit?
并列句	The man who'd spoken at the first meeting stood up and said, That child, Lord Faa, the one you spoke of as being sought, the one as is sitting in the front row now.
陈述句	I heard as all the folk living around the edge of the fens is having their houses turned upside down on her account.
陈述句	I heard there's a move in Parliament this very day to rescind our ancient privileges on account of this child.
并列句	Yes, friends, he said, over the babble of shocked whispers, they're a going to pass a law doing away with our right to free movement in and out the fens.
疑问句	Now, Lord Faa, what we want to know is this: who is this child on account of which we might come to such a pass?
陈述句	She en't a gyptian child, not as I heard.
疑问句	How comes it that a landloper child can put us all in danger?
陈述句	Lyra looked up at John Faa's massive frame.
陈述句	Her heart was thumping so much she could hardly hear the first words of his reply.
陈述句	Now spell it out, Raymond, don't be shy, he said.
疑问句	You want us to give this child up to them she's a fleeing from, is that right?
并列句	The man stood obstinately frowning, but said nothing.
并列句	Well, perhaps you would, and perhaps you wouldn't, John Faa continued.
并列句	But if any man or woman needs a reason for doing good, ponder on this.
陈述句	That little girl is the daughter of Lord Asriel, no less.
陈述句	For them as has forgotten, it were Lord Asriel who interceded with the Turk for the life of Sam Broekman.
陈述句	It were Lord Asriel who allowed gyptian boats free passage on the canals through his property.
并列句	It were Lord Asriel who defeated the Watercourse Bill in Parliament, to our great and lasting benefit.
并列句	And it were Lord Asriel who fought day and night in the floods of '53, and plunged headlong in the water twice to pull out young Ruud and Nellie Koopman.
疑问句	You forgotten that?
陈述句	Shame, shame on you, shame.
并列句	And now that same Lord Asriel is held in the farthest coldest darkest regions of the wild, captive, in the fortress of Svalbard.
疑问句	Do I need to tell you the kind of creatures a guarding him there?
并列句	And this is his little daughter in our care, and Raymond van Gerrit would hand her over to the authorities for a bit of peace and quiet.
疑问句	Is that right, Raymond?
并列句	Stand up and answer, man.
并列句	But Raymond van Gerrit had sunk to his seat, and nothing would make him stand.
并列句	A low hiss of disapproval sounded through the great hall, and Lyra felt the shame he must be feeling, as well as a deep glow of pride in her brave father.
并列句	John Faa turned away, and looked at the other men on the platform.
并列句	Nicholas Rokeby, I'm a putting you in charge of finding a vessel, and commanding her once we sail.
并列句	Adam Stefanski, I want you to take charge of the arms and munitions, and command the fighting.
陈述句	Roger van Poppel, you look to all the other stores, from food to cold-weather clothing.
并列句	Simon Hartmann, you be treasurer, and account to us all for a proper apportionment of our gold.
陈述句	Benjamin de Ruyter, I want you to take charge of spying.
并列句	There's a great deal we ought to find out, and I'm a giving you the charge of that, and you'll report to Farder Coram.
并列句	Michael Canzona, you're going to be responsible for coordinating the first four leaders' work, and you'll report to me, and if I die, you're my second in command and you'll take over.
并列句	Now I've made my dispositions according to custom, and if any man or woman seeks to disagree, they may do so freely.
陈述句	After a moment a woman stood up.
疑问句	Lord Faa, en't you a taking any women on this expedition to look after them kids once you found 'em?
陈述句	No, Nell.
陈述句	We shall have little space as it is.
陈述句	Any kids we free will be better off in our care than where they've been.
并列句	But supposing you find out that you can't rescue 'em without some women in disguise as guards or nurses or whatever?
陈述句	Well, I hadn't thought of that, John Faa admitted.
陈述句	We'll consider that most carefully when we retire into the parley room, you have my promise.
并列句	She sat down and a man stood up.
陈述句	Lord Faa, I heard you say that Lord Asriel is in captivity.
疑问句	Is it part of your plan to rescue him?
原因状语从句	Because if it is, and if he's in the power of them bears as I think you said, that's going to need more than a hundred and seventy men.
并列句	And good friend as Lord Asriel is to us, I don't know as there's any call on us to go as far as that.
陈述句	Adriaan Braks, you're not wrong.
并列句	What I had it in my mind to do was to keep our eyes and ears open and see what knowledge we can glean while we're in the North.
并列句	It may be that we can do something to help him, and it may not, but you can trust me not to use what you've provided, man and gold, for any purpose outside the stated one of finding our children and bringing 'em home.
陈述句	Another woman stood up.
陈述句	Lord Faa, we don't know what them Gobblers might've been doing to our children.
并列句	We all heard rumors and stories of fearful things.
并列句	We hear about children with no heads, or about children cut in half and sewn together, or about things too awful to mention.
并列句	I'm truly sorry to distress anyone, but we all heard this kind of thing, and I want to get it out in the open.
陈述句	Now in case you find anything of that awful kind, Lord Faa, I hope you're a going to take powerful revenge.
并列句	I hope you en't going to let thoughts of mercy and gentleness hold your hand back from striking and striking hard, and delivering a mighty blow to the heart of that infernal wickedness.
并列句	And I'm sure I speak for any mother as has lost a child to the Gobblers.
陈述句	There was a loud murmur of agreement as she sat down.
陈述句	Heads were nodding all over the Zaal.
并列句	John Faa waited for silence, and said: Nothing will hold my hand, Margaret, save only judgment.
条件状语从句	If I stay my hand in the North, it will only be to strike the harder in the South.
陈述句	To strike a day too soon is as bad as striking a hundred miles off.
陈述句	To be sure, there's a warm passion behind what you say.
并列句	But if you give in to that passion, friends, you're a doing what I always warned you agin: you're a placing the satisfaction of your own feelings above the work you have to do.
陈述句	Our work here is first rescue, then punishment.
陈述句	It en't gratification for upset feelings.
陈述句	Our feelings don't matter.
并列句	If we rescue the kids but we can't punish the Gobblers, we've done the main task.
并列句	But if we aim to punish the Gobblers first and by doing so lose the chance of rescuing the kids, we've failed.
并列句	But be assured of this, Margaret.
并列句	When the time comes to punish, we shall strike such a blow as'll make their hearts faint and fearful.
陈述句	We shall strike the strength out of 'em.
并列句	We shall leave them ruined and wasted, broken and shattered, torn in a thousand pieces and scattered to the four winds.
陈述句	Don't you worry that John Faa's heart is too soft to strike a blow when the time comes.
并列句	And the time will come under judgment.
陈述句	Not under passion.
疑问句	Is there anyone else who wants to speak?
条件状语从句	Speak if you will.
并列句	But no one did, and presently John Faa reached for the closing bell and rang it hard and loud, swinging it high and shaking the peals out of it so that they filled the hall and rang the rafters.
并列句	John Faa and the other men left the platform for the parley room.
陈述句	Lyra was a little disappointed.
疑问句	Didn't they want her there too?
并列句	But Tony laughed.
陈述句	They got plans to make, he said.
陈述句	You done your part, Lyra.
并列句	Now it's for John Faa and the council.
并列句	But I en't done nothing yet!
并列句	Lyra protested, as she followed the others reluctantly out of the hall and down the cobbled road toward the jetty.
感叹句	All I done was run away from Mrs. Coulter!
陈述句	That's just a beginning.
感叹句	I want to go north!
陈述句	Tell you what, said Tony, I'll bring you back a walrus tooth, that's what I'll do.
陈述句	Lyra scowled.
陈述句	For his part, Pantalaimon occupied himself by making monkey faces at Tony's daemon, who closed her tawny eyes in disdain.
并列句	Lyra drifted to the jetty and hung about with her new companions, dangling lanterns on strings over the black water to attract the goggle-eyed fishes who swam slowly up to be lunged at with sharp sticks and missed.
并列句	But her mind was on John Faa and the parley room, and before long she slipped away up the cobbles again to the Zaal.
陈述句	There was a light in the parley room window.
并列句	It was too high to look through, but she could hear a low rumble of voices inside.
并列句	So she walked up to the door and knocked on it firmly five times.
并列句	The voices stopped, a chair scraped across the floor, and the door opened, spilling warm naphtha light out on the damp step.
疑问句	Yes?
陈述句	said the man who'd opened it.
并列句	Beyond him Lyra could see the other men around the table, with bags of gold stacked neatly, and papers and pens, and glasses and a crock of jenniver.
陈述句	I want to come north, Lyra said so they could all hear it.
并列句	I want to come and help rescue the kids.
陈述句	That's what I set out to do when I run away from Mrs. Coulter.
并列句	And before that, even, I meant to rescue my friend Roger the kitchen boy from Jordan who was took.
并列句	I want to come and help.
并列句	I can do navigation and I can take anbaromagnetic readings off the Aurora, and I know what parts of a bear you can eat, and all kind of useful things.
并列句	You'd be sorry if you got up there and then found you needed me and found you'd left me behind.
并列句	And like that woman said, you might need women to play a part-well, you might need kids too.
陈述句	You don't know.
陈述句	So you oughter take me, Lord Faa, excuse me for interrupting your talk.
并列句	She was inside the room now, and all the men and their daemons were watching her, some with amusement and some with irritation, but she had eyes only for John Faa.
陈述句	Pantalaimon sat up in her arms, his wildcat eyes blazing green.
陈述句	John Faa said, Lyra, there en't no question of taking you into danger, so don't delude yourself, child.
并列句	Stay here and help Ma Costa and keep safe.
陈述句	That's what you got to do.
并列句	But I'm learning how to read the alethiometer, too.
感叹句	It's coming clearer every day!
感叹句	You're bound to need that-bound to!
陈述句	He shook his head.
陈述句	No, he said.
并列句	I know your heart was set on going north, but it's my belief not even Mrs. Coulter was going to take you.
条件状语从句	If you want to see the North, you'll have to wait till all this trouble's over.
陈述句	Now off you go.
并列句	Pantalaimon hissed quietly, but John Faa's daemon took off from the back of his chair and flew at them with black wings, not threateningly, but like a reminder of good manners; and Lyra turned on her heel as the crow glided over her head and wheeled back to John Faa.
陈述句	The door shut behind her with a decisive click.
陈述句	We will go, she said to Pantalaimon.
陈述句	Let 'em try to stop us.
感叹句	We will!
并列句	NINE   THE SPIES     Over the next few days, Lyra concocted a dozen plans and dismissed them impatiently; for they all boiled down to stowing away, and how could you stow away on a narrowboat?
并列句	To be sure, the real voyage would involve a proper ship, and she knew enough stories to expect all kinds of hiding places on a full-sized vessel: the lifeboats, the hold, the bilges, whatever they were; but she'd have to get to the ship first, and leaving the fens meant traveling the gyptian way.
并列句	And even if she got to the coast on her own, she might stow away on the wrong ship.
并列句	It would be a fine thing to hide in a lifeboat and wake up on the way to High Brazil.
并列句	Meanwhile, all around her the tantalizing work of assembling the expedition was going on day and night.
陈述句	She hung around Adam Stefanski, watching as he made his choice of the volunteers for the fighting force.
疑问句	She pestered Roger van Poppel with suggestions about the stores they needed to take: Had he remembered snow goggles?
疑问句	Did he know the best place to get arctic maps?
陈述句	The man she most wanted to help was Benjamin de Ruyter, the spy.
并列句	But he had slipped away in the early hours of the morning after the second roping, and naturally no one could say where he'd gone or when he'd return.
陈述句	So in default, Lyra attached herself to Farder Coram.
原因状语从句	I think it'd be best if I helped you, Farder Coram, she said, because I probably know more about the Gobblers than anyone else, being as I was nearly one of them.
陈述句	Probably you'll need me to help you understand Mr. de Ruyter's messages.
并列句	He took pity on the fierce, desperate little girl and didn't send her away.
并列句	Instead he talked to her, and listened to her memories of Oxford and of Mrs. Coulter, and watched as she read the alethiometer.
疑问句	Where's that book with all the symbols in?
陈述句	she asked him one day.
陈述句	In Heidelberg, he said.
并列句	And is there just the one?
并列句	There may be others, but that's the one I've seen.
陈述句	I bet there's one in Bodley's Library in Oxford, she said.
陈述句	She could hardly take her eyes off Farder Coram's daemon, who was the most beautiful daemon she'd ever seen.
并列句	When Pantalaimon was a cat, he was lean and ragged and harsh, but Sophonax, for that was her name, was golden-eyed and elegant beyond measure, fully twice as large as a real cat and richly furred.
陈述句	When the sunlight touched her, it lit up more shades of tawny-brown-leaf-hazel-corn-gold-autumn-mahogany than Lyra could name.
并列句	She longed to touch that fur, to rub her cheeks against it, but of course she never did; for it was the grossest breach of etiquette imaginable to touch another person's daemon.
并列句	Daemons might touch each other, of course, or fight; but the prohibition against human-daemon contact went so deep that even in battle no warrior would touch an enemy's daemon.
陈述句	It was utterly forbidden.
并列句	Lyra couldn't remember having to be told that: she just knew it, as instinctively as she felt that nausea was bad and comfort good.
并列句	So although she admired the fur of Sophonax and even speculated on what it might feel like, she never made the slightest move to touch her, and never would.
并列句	Sophonax was as sleek and healthy and beautiful as Farder Coram was ravaged and weak.
并列句	He might have been ill, or he might have suffered a crippling blow, but the result was that he could not walk without leaning on two sticks, and he trembled constantly like an aspen leaf.
并列句	His mind was sharp and clear and powerful, though, and soon Lyra came to love him for his knowledge and for the firm way he directed her.
疑问句	What's that hourglass mean, Farder Coram?
陈述句	she asked, over the alethiometer, one sunny morning in his boat.
陈述句	It keeps coming back to that.
条件状语从句	There's often a clue there if you look more close.
疑问句	What's that little old thing on top of it?
并列句	She screwed up her eyes and peered.
感叹句	That's a skull!
疑问句	So what d'you think that might mean?
疑问句	Death...Is that death?
陈述句	That's right.
陈述句	So in the hourglass range of meanings you get death.
陈述句	In fact, after time, which is the first one, death is the second one.
疑问句	D'you know what I noticed, Farder Coram?
感叹句	The needle stops there on the second go-round!
并列句	On the first round it kind of twitches, and on the second it stops.
疑问句	Is that saying it's the second meaning, then?
陈述句	Probably.
疑问句	What are you asking it, Lyra?
陈述句	I'm a thinking- she stopped, surprised to find that she'd actually been asking a question without realizing it.
原因状语从句	I just put three pictures together because...!
并列句	was thinking about Mr. de Ruyter, see....And I put together the serpent and the crucible and the beehive, to ask how he's a getting on with his spying, and- Why them three symbols?
原因状语从句	Because I thought the serpent was cunning, like a spy ought to be, and the crucible could mean like knowledge, what you kind of distill, and the beehive was hard work, like bees are always working hard; so out of the hard work and the cunning comes the knowledge, see, and that's the spy's job; and I pointed to them and I thought the question in my mind, and the needle stopped at death....D'you think that could be really working, Farder Coram?
陈述句	It's working all right, Lyra.
陈述句	What we don't know is whether we're reading it right.
陈述句	That's a subtle art.
并列句	I wonder if- Before he could finish his sentence, there was an urgent knock at the door, and a young gyptian man came in.
并列句	Beg pardon, Farder Coram, there's Jacob Huismans just come back, and he's sore wounded.
陈述句	He was with Benjamin de Ruyter, said Farder Coram.
疑问句	What's happened?
陈述句	He won't speak, said the young man.
陈述句	You better come, Farder Coram, 'cause he won't last long, he's a bleeding inside.
并列句	Farder Coram and Lyra exchanged a look of alarm and wonderment, but only for a second, and then Farder Coram was hobbling out on his sticks as fast as he could manage, with his daemon padding ahead of him.
陈述句	Lyra came too, hopping with impatience.
陈述句	The young man led them to a boat tied up at the sugar-beet jetty, where a woman in a red flannel apron held open the door for them.
陈述句	Seeing her suspicious glance at Lyra, Farder Coram said, It's important the girl hears what Jacob's got to say, mistress.
并列句	So the woman let them in and stood back, with her squirrel daemon perched silent on the wooden clock.
并列句	On a bunk under a patchwork coverlet lay a man whose white face was damp with sweat and whose eyes were glazed.
陈述句	I've sent for the physician, Farder Coram, said the woman shakily.
陈述句	Please don't agitate him.
陈述句	He's in an agony of pain.
陈述句	He come in off Peter Hawker's boat just a few minutes ago.
疑问句	Where's Peter now?
陈述句	He's a tying up.
陈述句	It was him said I had to send for you.
陈述句	Quite right.
疑问句	Now, Jacob, can ye hear me?
并列句	Jacob's eyes rolled to look at Farder Coram sitting on the opposite bunk, a foot or two away.
陈述句	Hello, Farder Coram, he murmured.
陈述句	Lyra looked at his daemon.
并列句	She was a ferret, and she lay very still beside his head, curled up but not asleep, for her eyes were open and glazed like his.
疑问句	What happened?
陈述句	said Farder Coram.
陈述句	Benjamin's dead, came the answer.
并列句	He's dead, and Gerard's captured.
并列句	His voice was hoarse and his breath was shallow.
原因状语从句	When he stopped speaking, his daemon uncurled painfully and licked his cheek, and taking strength from that he went on: We was breaking into the Ministry of Theology, because Benjamin had heard from one of the Gobblers we caught that the headquarters was there, that's where all the orders was coming from....
陈述句	He stopped again.
疑问句	You captured some Gobblers?
陈述句	said Farder Coram.
并列句	Jacob nodded, and cast his eyes at his daemon.
并列句	It was unusual for daemons to speak to humans other than their own, but it happened sometimes, and she spoke now.
并列句	We caught three Gobblers in Clerkenwell and made them tell us who they were working for and where the orders came from and so on.
并列句	They didn't know where the kids were being taken, except it was north to Lapland.... She had to stop and pant briefly, her little chest fluttering, before she could go on.
并列句	And so them Gobblers told us about the Ministry of Theology and Lord Boreal.
并列句	Benjamin said him and Gerard Hook should break into the Ministry and Frans Broekman and Tom Mendham should go and find out about Lord Boreal.
疑问句	Did they do that?
陈述句	We don't know.
陈述句	They never came back.
并列句	Farder Coram, it were like everything we did, they knew about before we did it, and for all we know Frans and Tom were swallowed alive as soon as they got near Lord Boreal.
并列句	Come back to Benjamin, said Farder Coram, hearing Jacob's breathing getting harsher and seeing his eyes close in pain.
并列句	Jacob's daemon gave a little mew of anxiety and love, and the woman took a step or two closer, her hands to her mouth; but she didn't speak, and the daemon went on faintly: Benjamin and Gerard and us went to the Ministry at White Hall and found a little side door, it not being fiercely guarded, and we stayed on watch outside while they unfastened the lock and went in.
并列句	They hadn't been in but a minute when we heard a cry of fear, and Benjamin's daemon came a flying out and beckoned to us for help and flew in again, and we took our knife and ran in after her; only the place was dark, and full of wild forms and sounds that were confusing in their frightful movements; and we cast about, but there was a commotion above, and a fearful cry, and Benjamin and his daemon fell from a high staircase above us, his daemon a tugging and a fluttering to hold him up, but all in vain, for they crashed on the stone floor and both perished in a moment.
并列句	And we couldn't see anything of Gerard, but there was a howl from above in his voice and we were too terrified and stunned to move, and then an arrow shot down at our shoulder and pierced deep down within....
并列句	The daemon's voice was fainter, and a groan came from the wounded man.
并列句	Farder Coram leaned forward and gently pulled back the counterpane, and there protruding from Jacob's shoulder was the feathered end of an arrow in a mass of clotted blood.
并列句	The shaft and the head were so deep in the poor man's chest that only six inches or so remained above the skin.
陈述句	Lyra felt faint.
并列句	There was the sound of feet and voices outside on the jetty.
并列句	Farder Coram sat up and said, Here's the physician, Jacob.
陈述句	We'll leave you now.
陈述句	We'll have a longer talk when you're feeling better.
陈述句	He clasped the woman's shoulder on the way out.
原因状语从句	Lyra stuck close to him on the jetty, because there was a crowd gathering already, whispering and pointing.
并列句	Farder Coram gave orders for Peter Hawker to go at once to John Faa, and then said: Lyra, as soon as we know whether Jacob's going to live or die, we must have another talk about that alethiometer.
并列句	You go and occupy yourself elsewhere, child; we'll send for you.
并列句	Lyra wandered away on her own, and went to the reedy bank to sit and throw mud into the water.
并列句	She knew one thing: she was not pleased or proud to be able to read the alethiometer- she was afraid.
并列句	Whatever power was making that needle swing and stop, it knew things like an intelligent being.
并列句	I reckon it's a spirit, Lyra said, and for a moment she was tempted to throw the little thing into the middle of the fen.
条件状语从句	I'd see a spirit if there was one in there, said Pantalaimon.
陈述句	Like that old ghost in Godstow.
陈述句	I saw that when you didn't.
陈述句	There's more than one kind of spirit, said Lyra reprovingly.
陈述句	You can't see all of 'em.
疑问句	Anyway, what about those old dead Scholars without their heads?
陈述句	I saw them, remember.
陈述句	That was only a night-ghast.
陈述句	It was not.
并列句	They were proper spirits all right, and you know it.
并列句	But whatever spirits's moving this blooming needle en't that sort of spirit.
陈述句	It might not be a spirit, said Pantalaimon stubbornly.
疑问句	Well, what else could it be?
陈述句	It might be...it might be elementary particles.
陈述句	She scoffed.
感叹句	It could be!
陈述句	he insisted.
疑问句	You remember that photomill they got at Gabriel?
陈述句	Well, then.
陈述句	At Gabriel College there was a very holy object kept on the high altar of the oratory, covered (now Lyra thought about it) with a black velvet cloth, like the one around the alethiometer.
陈述句	She had seen it when she accompanied the Librarian of Jordan to a service there.
陈述句	At the height of the invocation the Intercessor lifted the cloth to reveal in the dimness a glass dome inside which there was something too distant to see, until he pulled a string attached to a shutter above, letting a ray of sunlight through to strike the dome exactly.
并列句	Then it became clear: a little thing like a weathervane, with four sails black on one side and white on the other, that began to whirl around as the light struck it.
并列句	It illustrated a moral lesson, the Intercessor explained, and went on to explain what that was.
并列句	Five minutes later Lyra had forgotten the moral, but she hadn't forgotten the little whirling vanes in the ray of dusty light.
并列句	They were delightful whatever they meant, and all done by the power of photons, said the Librarian as they walked home to Jordan.
陈述句	So perhaps Pantalaimon was right.
并列句	If elementary particles could push a photomill around, no doubt they could make light work of a needle; but it still troubled her.
感叹句	Lyra!
感叹句	Lyra!
陈述句	It was Tony Costa, waving to her from the jetty.
陈述句	Come over here, he called.
并列句	You got to go and see John Faa at the Zaal.
陈述句	Run, gal, it's urgent.
并列句	She found John Faa with Farder Coram and the other leaders, looking troubled.
陈述句	John Faa spoke: Lyra, child, Farder Coram has told me about your reading of that instrument.
并列句	And I'm sorry to say that poor Jacob has just died.
陈述句	I think we're going to have to take you with us after all, against my inclinations.
并列句	I'm troubled in my mind about it, but there don't seem to be any alternative.
陈述句	As soon as Jacob's buried according to custom, we'll take our way.
并列句	You understand me, Lyra: you're a coming too, but it en't an occasion for joy or jubilation.
并列句	There's trouble and danger ahead for all of us.
陈述句	I'm a putting you under Farder Coram's wing.
并列句	Don't you be a trouble or a hazard to him, or you'll be a feeling the force of my wrath.
并列句	Now cut along and explain to Ma Costa, and hold yourself in readiness to leave.
陈述句	The next two weeks passed more busily than any time of Lyra's life so far.
并列句	Busily, but not quickly, for there were tedious stretches of waiting, of hiding in damp crabbed closets, of watching a dismal rain-soaked autumn landscape roll past the window, of hiding again, of sleeping near the gas fumes of the engine and waking with a sick headache, and worst of all, of never once being allowed out into the air to run along the bank or clamber over the deck or haul at the lock gates or catch a mooring rope thrown from the lockside.
原因状语从句	Because, of course, she had to remain hidden.
并列句	Tony Costa told her of the gossip in the waterside pubs: that there was a hunt the length of the kingdom for a little fair-haired girl, with a big reward for her discovery and severe punishment for anyone concealing her.
并列句	There were strange rumors too: people said she was the only child to have escaped from the Gobblers, and she had terrible secrets in her possession.
并列句	Another rumor said she wasn't a human child at all but a pair of spirits in the form of child and daemon, sent to this world by the infernal powers in order to work great ruin; and yet another rumor said it was no child but a fully grown human, shrunk by magic and in the pay of the Tartars, come to spy on good English people and prepare the way for a Tartar invasion.
并列句	Lyra heard these tales at first with glee and later with despondency.
并列句	All those people hating and fearing her!
并列句	And she longed to be out of this narrow boxy cabin.
陈述句	She longed to be north already, in the wide snows under the blazing Aurora.
并列句	And sometimes she longed to be back at Jordan College, scrambling over the roofs with Roger with the Steward's bell tolling half an hour to dinnertime and the clatter and sizzle and shouting of the kitchen....Then she wished passionately that nothing had changed, nothing would ever change, that she could be Lyra of Jordan College forever and ever.
并列句	The one thing that drew her out of her boredom and irritation was the alethiometer.
并列句	She read it every day, sometimes with Farder Coram and sometimes on her own, and she found that she could sink more and more readily into the calm state in which the symbol meanings clarified themselves, and those great mountain ranges touched by sunlight emerged into vision.
陈述句	She struggled to explain to Farder Coram what it felt like.
原因状语从句	It's almost like talking to someone, only you can't quite hear them, and you feel kind of stupid because they're cleverer than you, only they don't get cross or any thing.... And they know such a lot, Farder Coram!
条件状语从句	As if they knew everything, almost!
并列句	Mrs. Coulter was clever, she knew ever such a lot, but this is a different kind of knowing....It's like understanding, I suppose....
并列句	He would ask specific questions, and she would search for answers.
疑问句	What's Mrs. Coulter doing now?
并列句	he'd say, and her hands would move at once, and he'd say, Tell me what you're doing.
并列句	Well, the Madonna is Mrs. Coulter, and I think my mother when I put the hand there; and the ant is busy-that's easy, that's the top meaning; and the hourglass has got time in its meanings, and partway down there's now, and I just fix my mind on it.
并列句	And how do you know where these meanings are?
陈述句	I kind of see 'em.
并列句	Or feel 'em rather, like climbing down a ladder at night, you put your foot down and there's another rung.
并列句	Well, I put my mind down and there's another meaning, and I kind of sense what it is.
陈述句	Then I put 'em all together.
陈述句	There's a trick in it like focusing your eyes.
并列句	Do that then, and see what it says.
陈述句	Lyra did.
并列句	The long needle began to swing at once, and stopped, moved on, stopped again in a precise series of sweeps and pauses.
并列句	It was a sensation of such grace and power that Lyra, sharing it, felt like a young bird learning to fly.
并列句	Farder Coram, watching from across the table, noted the places where the needle stopped, and watched the little girl holding her hair back from her face and biting her lower lip just a little, her eyes following the needle at first but then, when its path was settled, looking elsewhere on the dial.
让步状语从句	Not randomly, though.
并列句	Farder Coram was a chess player, and he knew how chess players looked at a game in play.
并列句	An expert player seemed to see lines of force and influence on the board, and looked along the important lines and ignored the weak ones; and Lyra's eyes moved the same way, according to some similar magnetic field that she could see and he couldn't.
并列句	The needle stopped at the thunderbolt, the infant, the serpent, the elephant, and at a creature Lyra couldn't find a name for: a sort of lizard with big eyes and a tail curled around the twig it stood on.
陈述句	It repeated the sequence time after time, while Lyra watched.
疑问句	What's that lizard mean?
陈述句	said Farder Coram, breaking into her concentration.
感叹句	It don't make sense....!
并列句	can see what it says, but I must be misreading it.
并列句	The thunderbolt I think is anger, and the child ...I think it's me...l was getting a meaning for that lizard thing, but you talked to me, Farder Coram, and I lost it.
陈述句	See, it's just floating any old where.
陈述句	Yes, I see that.
陈述句	I'm sorry, Lyra.
疑问句	You tired now?
疑问句	D'you want to stop?
并列句	No, I don't, she said, but her cheeks were flushed and her eyes bright.
并列句	She had all the signs of fretful overexcitement, and it was made worse by her long confinement in this stuffy cabin.
陈述句	He looked out of the window.
并列句	It was nearly dark, and they were traveling along the last stretch of inland water before reaching the coast.
并列句	Wide brown scummed expanses of an estuary extended under a dreary sky to a distant group of coal-spirit tanks, rusty and cobwebbed with pipework, beside a refinery where a thick smear of smoke ascended reluctantly to join the clouds.
疑问句	Where are we?
陈述句	said Lyra.
疑问句	Can I go outside just for a bit, Farder Coram?
陈述句	This is Colby water, he said.
陈述句	The estuary of the river Cole.
并列句	When we reach the town, we'll tie up by the Smoke-market and go on foot to the docks.
并列句	We'll be there in an hour or two....
并列句	But it was getting dark, and in the wide desolation of the creek nothing was moving but their own boat and a distant coal barge laboring toward the refinery; and Lyra was so flushed and tired, and she'd been inside for so long; and so Farder Coram went on: Well, I don't suppose it'll matter just for a few minutes in the open air.
并列句	I wouldn't call it fresh; ten't fresh except when it's blowing off the sea; but you can sit out on top and look around till we get closer in.
并列句	Lyra leaped up, and Pantalaimon became a seagull at once, eager to stretch his wings in the open.
并列句	It was cold outside, and although she was well wrapped up, Lyra was soon shivering.
并列句	Pantalaimon, on the other hand, leaped into the air with a loud caw of delight, and wheeled and skimmed and darted now ahead of the boat, now behind the stern.
并列句	Lyra exulted in it, feeling with him as he flew, and urging him mentally to provoke the old tillerman's cormorant daemon into a race.
并列句	But she ignored him and settled down sleepily on the handle of the tiller near her man.
并列句	There was no life out on this bitter brown expanse, and only the steady chug of the engine and the subdued splashing of the water under the bows broke the wide silence.
陈述句	Heavy clouds hung low without offering rain; the air beneath was grimy with smoke.
并列句	Only Pantalaimon's flashing elegance had anything in it of life and joy.
并列句	As he soared up out of a dive with wide wings white against the gray, something black hurtled at him and struck.
并列句	He fell sideways in a flutter of shock and pain, and Lyra cried out, feeling it sharply.
并列句	Another little black thing joined the first; they moved not like birds but like flying beetles, heavy and direct, and with a droning sound.
并列句	As Pantalaimon fell, trying to twist away and make for the boat and Lyra's desperate arms, the black things kept driving into him, droning, buzzing, and murderous.
并列句	Lyra was nearly mad with Pantalaimon's fear and her own, but then something swept past her and upward.
并列句	It was the tillerman's daemon, and clumsy and heavy as she looked, her flight was powerful and swift.
并列句	Her head snapped this way and that-there was a flutter of black wings, a shiver of white-and a little black thing fell to the tarred roof of the cabin at Lyra's feet just as Pantalaimon landed on her outstretched hand.
并列句	Before she could comfort him, he changed into his wildcat shape and sprang down on the creature, batting it back from the edge of the roof, where it was crawling swiftly to escape.
并列句	Pantalaimon held it firmly down with a needle-filled paw and looked up at the darkening sky, where the black wing flaps of the cormorant were circling higher as she cast around for the other.
并列句	Then the cormorant glided swiftly back and croaked something to the tillerman, who said, It's gone.
陈述句	Don't let that other one escape.
并列句	Here- and he flung the dregs out of the tin mug he'd been drinking from, and tossed it to Lyra.
陈述句	She clapped it over the creature at once.
并列句	It buzzed and snarled like a little machine.
并列句	Hold it still, said Farder Coram from behind her, and then he was kneeling to slip a piece of card under the mug.
疑问句	What is it, Farder Coram?
陈述句	she said shakily.
并列句	Let's go below and have a look.
陈述句	Take it careful, Lyra.
陈述句	Hold that tight.
并列句	She looked at the tillerman's daemon as she passed, intending to thank her, but her old eyes were closed.
陈述句	She thanked the tillerman instead.
陈述句	You oughter stayed below was all he said.
陈述句	She took the mug into the cabin, where Farder Coram had found a beer glass.
并列句	He held the tin mug upside down over it and then slipped the card out from between them, so that the creature fell into the glass.
陈述句	He held it up so they could see the angry little thing clearly.
并列句	It was about as long as Lyra's thumb, and dark green, not black.
并列句	Its wing cases were erect, like a ladybird's about to fly, and the wings inside were beating so furiously that they were only a blur.
陈述句	Its six clawed legs were scrabbling on the smooth glass.
疑问句	What is it?
陈述句	she said.
并列句	Pantalaimon, a wildcat still, crouched on the table six inches away, his green eyes following it round and round inside the glass.
条件状语从句	If you was to crack it open, said Farder Coram, you'd find no living thing in there.
陈述句	No animal nor insect, at any rate.
并列句	I seen one of these things afore, and I never thought I'd see one again this far north.
陈述句	Afric things.
并列句	There's a clockwork running in there, and pinned to the spring of it, there's a bad spirit with a spell through its heart.
并列句	But who sent it?
陈述句	You don't even need to read the symbols, Lyra; you can guess as easy as I can.
疑问句	Mrs. Coulter?
陈述句	'Course.
陈述句	She en't only explored up north; there's strange things aplenty in the southern wild.
陈述句	It was Morocco where I saw one of these last.
并列句	Deadly dangerous; while the spirit's in it, it won't never stop, and when you let the spirit free, it's so monstrous angry it'll kill the first thing it gets at.
并列句	But what was it after?
陈述句	Spying.
陈述句	I was a cursed fool to let you up above.
并列句	And I should have let you think your way through the symbols without interrupting.
感叹句	I see it now!
陈述句	said Lyra, suddenly excited.
感叹句	It means air, that lizard thing!
并列句	I saw that, but I couldn't see why, so I tried to work it out and I lost it.
陈述句	Ah, said Farder Coram, then I see it too.
陈述句	It en't a lizard, that's why; it's a chameleon.
原因状语从句	And it stands for air because they don't eat nor drink, they just live on air.
并列句	And the elephant- Africa, he said, and Aha.
陈述句	They looked at each other.
陈述句	With every revelation of the alethiometer's power, they became more awed by it.
陈述句	It was telling us about these things all the time, said Lyra.
陈述句	We oughter listened.
并列句	But what can we do about this un, Farder Coram?
并列句	Can we kill it or something?
陈述句	I don't know as we can do anything.
并列句	We shall just have to keep him shut up tight in a box and never let him out.
陈述句	What worries me more is the other one, as got away.
陈述句	He'll be a flying back to Mrs. Coulter now, with the news that he's seen you.
并列句	Damn me, Lyra, but I'm a fool.
并列句	He rattled about in a cupboard and found a smokeleaf tin about three inches in diameter.
并列句	It had been used for holding screws, but he tipped those out and wiped the inside with a rag before inverting the glass over it with the card still in place over the mouth.
并列句	After a tricky moment when one of the creature's legs escaped and thrust the tin away with surprising strength, they had it captured and the lid screwed down tight.
陈述句	As soon's we get about the ship I'll run some solder round the edge to make sure of it, Farder Coram said.
并列句	But don't clockwork run down?
陈述句	Ordinary clockwork, yes.
并列句	But like I said, this un's kept tight wound by the spirit pinned to the end.
并列句	The more he struggles, the tighter it's wound, and the stronger the force is.
陈述句	Now let's put this feller out the way....
并列句	He wrapped the tin in a flannel cloth to stifle the incessant buzzing and droning, and stowed it away under his bunk.
并列句	It was dark now, and Lyra watched through the window as the lights of Colby came closer.
并列句	The heavy air was thickening into mist, and by the time they tied up at the wharves alongside the Smokemarket everything in sight was softened and blurred.
并列句	The darkness shaded into pearly silver-gray veils laid over the warehouses and the cranes, the wooden market stalls and the granite many-chimneyed building the market was named after, where day and night fish hung kippering in the fragrant oakwood smoke.
并列句	The chimneys were contributing their thickness to the clammy air, and the pleasant reek of smoked herring and mackerel and haddock seemed to breathe out of the very cobbles.
并列句	Lyra, wrapped up in oilskin and with a large hood hiding her revealing hair, walked along between Farder Coram and the tillerman.
陈述句	All three daemons were alert, scouting around corners ahead, watching behind, listening for the slightest footfall.
并列句	But they were the only figures to be seen.
陈述句	The citizens of Colby were all indoors, probably sipping jenniver beside roaring stoves.
并列句	They saw no one until they reached the dock, and the first man they saw there was Tony Costa, guarding the gates.
陈述句	Thank God you got here, he said quietly, letting them through.
并列句	We just heard as Jack Verhoeven's been shot and his boat sunk, and no one'd heard where you was.
并列句	John Faa's on board already and jumping to go.
并列句	The vessel looked immense to Lyra: a wheelhouse and funnel amidships, a high fo'c'sle and a stout derrick over a canvas-covered hatch; yellow light agleam in the portholes and the bridge, and white light at the masthead; and three or four men on deck, working urgently at things she couldn't see.
并列句	She hurried up the wooden gangway ahead of Farder Coram, and looked around with excitement.
并列句	Pantalaimon became a monkey and clambered up the derrick at once, but she called him down again; Farder Coram wanted them indoors, or below, as you called it on board ship.
并列句	Down some stairs, or a companionway, there was a small saloon where John Faa was talking quietly with Nicholas Rokeby, the gyptian in charge of the vessel.
陈述句	John Faa did nothing hastily.
并列句	Lyra was waiting for him to greet her, but he finished his remarks about the tide and pilotage before turning to the incomers.
陈述句	Good evening, friends, he said.
陈述句	Poor Jack Verhoeven's dead, perhaps you've heard.
并列句	And his boys captured.
并列句	We have bad news too, said Farder Coram, and told of their encounter with the flying spirits.
并列句	John Faa shook his great head, but didn't reproach them.
疑问句	Where is the creature now?
陈述句	he said.
并列句	Farder Coram took out the leaf tin and laid it on the table.
陈述句	Such a furious buzzing came from it that the tin itself moved slowly over the wood.
并列句	I've heard of them clockwork devils, but never seen one, John Faa said.
并列句	There en't no way of taming it and turning it back, I do know that much.
原因状语从句	Nor is it any use weighing it down with lead and dropping it in the ocean, because one day it'd rust through and out the devil would come and make for the child wherever she was.
并列句	No, we'll have to keep it by, and exercise our vigilance.
陈述句	Lyra being the only female on board (for John Faa had decided against taking women, after much thought), she had a cabin to herself.
并列句	Not a grand cabin, to be sure; in fact, little more than a closet with a bunk and a scuttle, which was the proper name for porthole.
并列句	She stowed her few things in the drawer below the bunk and ran up excitedly to lean over the rail and watch England vanish behind, only to find that most of England had vanished in the mist before she got there.
并列句	But the rush of water below, the movement in the air, the ship's lights glowing bravely in the dark, the rumble of the engine, the smells of salt and fish and coal spirit were exciting enough by themselves.
陈述句	It wasn't long before another sensation joined them, as the vessel began to roll in the German Ocean swell.
原因状语从句	When someone called Lyra down for a bite of supper, she found she was less hungry than she'd thought, and presently she decided it would be a good idea to lie down, for Pantalaimon's sake, because the poor creature was feeling sadly ill at ease.
并列句	And so began her journey to the North.
并列句	PART   TWO   BOLVAHGAR         TEN   THE CONSUL AHD THE BEAR     John Faa and the other leaders had decided that they would make for Trollesund, the main port of Lapland.
并列句	The witches had a consulate in the town, and John Faa knew that without their help, or at least their friendly neutrality, it would be impossible to rescue the captive children.
并列句	He explained his idea to Lyra and Farder Coram the next day, when Lyra's seasickness had abated slightly.
并列句	The sun was shining brightly and the green waves were dashing against the bows, bearing white streams of foam as they curved away.
并列句	Out on the deck, with the breeze blowing and the whole sea a-sparkle with light and movement, she felt little sickness at all; and now that Pantalaimon had discovered the delights of being a seagull and then a stormy petrel and skimming the wave tops, Lyra was too absorbed by his glee to wallow in landlubberly misery.
并列句	John Faa, Farder Coram, and two or three others sat in the stern of the ship, with the sun full on them, talking about what to do next.
陈述句	Now, Farder Coram knows these Lapland witches, John Faa said.
并列句	And if I en't mistaken, there's an obligation there.
陈述句	That's right, John, said Farder Coram.
并列句	It were forty years back, but that's nothing to a witch.
陈述句	Some of 'em live to many times that.
疑问句	What happened to bring this obligation about, Farder Coram?
陈述句	said Adam Stefanski, the man in charge of the fighting troop.
陈述句	I saved a witch's life, Farder Coram explained.
陈述句	She fell out of the air, being pursued by a great red bird like to nothing I'd seen before.
并列句	She fell injured in the marsh and I set out to find her.
并列句	She was like to drowning, and I got her on board and shot that bird down, and it fell into a bog, to my regret, for it was as big as a bittern, and flame-red.
陈述句	Ah, the other men murmured, captured by Farder Coram's story.
原因状语从句	Now, when I got her in the boat, he went on, I had the most grim shock I'd ever known, because that young woman had no daemon.
条件状语从句	It was as if he'd said, She had no head.
陈述句	The very thought was repugnant.
并列句	The men shuddered, their daemons bristled or shook themselves or cawed harshly, and the men soothed them.
陈述句	Pantalaimon crept into Lyra's arms, their hearts beating together.
陈述句	At least, Farder Coram said, that's what it seemed.
陈述句	Being as she'd fell out of the air, I more than suspected she was a witch.
并列句	She looked exactly like a young woman, thinner than some and prettier than most, but not seeing that daemon gave me a hideous turn.
疑问句	En't they got daemons then, the witches?
陈述句	said the other man, Michael Canzona.
陈述句	Their daemons is invisible, I expect, said Adam Stefanski.
并列句	He was there all the time, and Farder Coram never saw him.
陈述句	No, you're wrong, Adam, said Farder Coram.
陈述句	He weren't there at all.
陈述句	The witches have the power to separate their-selves from their daemons a mighty sight further'n what we can.
并列句	If need be, they can send their daemons far abroad on the wind or the clouds, or down below the ocean.
原因状语从句	And this witch I found, she hadn't been resting above an hour when her daemon came a flying back, because he'd felt her fear and her injury, of course.
并列句	And it's my belief, though she never admitted to this, that the great red bird I shot was another witch's daemon, in pursuit.
感叹句	Lord!
陈述句	That made me shiver, when I thought of that.
并列句	I'd have stayed my hand; I'd have taken any measures on sea or land; but there it was.
并列句	Anyway, there was no doubt I'd saved her life, and she gave me a token of it, and said I was to call on her help if ever it was needed.
并列句	And once she sent me help when the Skraelings shot me with a poison arrow.
并列句	We had other connections, too....I haven't seen her from that day to this, but she'll remember.
并列句	And does she live at Trollesund, this witch?
陈述句	No, no.
并列句	They live in forests and on the tundra, not in a seaport among men and women.
陈述句	Their business is with the wild.
并列句	But they keep a consul there, and I shall get word to her, make no doubt about that.
并列句	Lyra was keen to know more about the witches, but the men had turned their talk to the matter of fuel and stores, and presently she grew impatient to see the rest of the ship.
并列句	She wandered along the deck toward the bows, and soon made the acquaintance of an able seaman by flicking at him the pips she'd saved from the apple she'd eaten at breakfast.
并列句	He was a stout and placid man, and when he'd sworn at her and been sworn at in return, they became great friends.
陈述句	He was called Jerry.
并列句	Under his guidance she found out that having something to do prevented you from feeling seasick, and that even a job like scrubbing a deck could be satisfying, if it was done in a seamanlike way.
并列句	She was very taken with this notion, and later on she folded the blankets on her bunk in a seamanlike way, and put her possessions in the closet in a seamanlike way, and used stow instead of tidy for the process of doing so.
陈述句	After two days at sea, Lyra decided that this was the life for her.
并列句	She had the run of the ship, from the engine room to the bridge, and she was soon on first-name terms with all the crew.
并列句	Captain Rokeby let her signal to a Hollands frigate by pulling the handle of the steam whistle; the cook suffered her help in mixing plum duff; and only a stern word from John Faa prevented her from climbing the foremast to inspect the horizon from the crow's nest.
并列句	All the time they were steaming north, and it grew colder daily.
并列句	The ship's stores were searched for oilskins that could be cut down for her, and Jerry showed her how to sew, an art she learned willingly from him, though she had scorned it at Jordan and avoided instruction from Mrs. Lonsdale.
陈述句	Together they made a waterproof bag for the alethiometer that she could wear around her waist, in case she fell in the sea, she said.
并列句	With it safely in place she clung to the rail in her oilskins and sou'wester as the stinging spray broke over the bows and surged along the deck.
原因状语从句	She still felt seasick occasionally, especially when the wind got up and the ship plunged heavily over the crests of the gray-green waves, and then it was Pantalaimon's job to distract her from it by skimming the waves as a stormy petrel; because she could feel his boundless glee in the dash of wind and water, and forget her nausea.
并列句	From time to time he even tried being a fish, and once joined a school of dolphins, to their surprise and pleasure.
并列句	Lyra stood shivering in the fo'c'sle and laughed with delight as her beloved Pantalaimon, sleek and powerful, leaped from the water with half a dozen other swift gray shapes.
并列句	He had to stay close to the ship, of course, for he could never go far from her; but she sensed his desire to speed as far and as fast as he could, for pure exhilaration.
并列句	She shared his pleasure, but for her it wasn't simple pleasure, for there was pain and fear in it too.
疑问句	Suppose he loved being a dolphin more than he loved being with her on land?
疑问句	What would she do then?
并列句	Her friend the able seaman was nearby, and he paused as he adjusted the canvas cover of the forward hatch to look out at the little girl's daemon skimming and leaping with the dolphins.
陈述句	His own daemon, a seagull, had her head tucked under her wing on the capstan.
陈述句	He knew what Lyra was feeling.
并列句	I remember when I first went to sea, my Belisaria hadn't settled on one form, I was that young, and she loved being a porpoise.
陈述句	I was afraid she'd settle like that.
原因状语从句	There was one old sailorman on my first vessel who could never go ashore at all, because his daemon had settled as a dolphin, and he could never leave the water.
并列句	He was a wonderful sailor, best navigator you ever knew; could have made a fortune at the fishing, but he wasn't happy at it.
并列句	He was never quite happy till he died and he could be buried at sea.
疑问句	Why do daemons have to settle?
陈述句	Lyra said.
陈述句	I want Pantalaimon to be able to change forever.
陈述句	So does he.
并列句	Ah, they always have settled, and they always will.
陈述句	That's part of growing up.
并列句	There'll come a time when you'll be tired of his changing about, and you'll want a settled kind of form for him.
感叹句	I never will!
陈述句	Oh, you will.
陈述句	You'll want to grow up like all the other girls.
陈述句	Anyway, there's compensations for a settled form.
疑问句	What are they?
陈述句	Knowing what kind of person you are.
陈述句	Take old Belisaria.
并列句	She's a seagull, and that means I'm a kind of seagull too.
并列句	I'm not grand and splendid nor beautiful, but I'm a tough old thing and I can survive anywhere and always find a bit of food and company.
陈述句	That's worth knowing, that is.
并列句	And when your daemon settles, you'll know the sort of person you are.
并列句	But suppose your daemon settles in a shape you don't like?
疑问句	Well, then, you're discontented, en't you?
并列句	There's plenty of folk as'd like to have a lion as a daemon and they end up with a poodle.
并列句	And till they learn to be satisfied with what they are, they're going to be fretful about it.
陈述句	Waste of feeling, that is.
并列句	But it didn't seem to Lyra that she would ever grow up.
并列句	One morning there was a different smell in the air, and the ship was moving oddly, with a brisker rocking from side to side instead of the plunging and soaring.
条件状语从句	Lyra was on deck a minute after she woke up, gazing greedily at the land: such a strange sight, after all that water, for though they had only been at sea a few days, Lyra felt as if they'd been on the ocean for months.
并列句	Directly ahead of the ship a mountain rose, green flanked and snow-capped, and a little town and harbor lay below it: wooden houses with steep roofs, an oratory spire, cranes in the harbor, and clouds of gulls wheeling and crying.
并列句	The smell was of fish, but mixed with it came land smells too: pine resin and earth and something animal and musky, and something else that was cold and blank and wild: it might have been snow.
陈述句	It was the smell of the North.
陈述句	Seals frisked around the ship, showing their clown faces above the water before sinking back without a splash.
并列句	The wind that lifted spray off the white-capped waves was monstrously cold, and searched out every gap in Lyra's wolfskin, and her hands were soon aching and her face numb.
并列句	Pantalaimon, in his ermine shape, warmed her neck for her, but it was too cold to stay outside for long without work to do, even to watch the seals, and Lyra went below to eat her breakfast porridge and look through the porthole in the saloon.
并列句	Inside the harbor the water was calm, and as they moved past the massive breakwater Lyra began to feel unsteady from the lack of motion.
并列句	She and Pantalaimon avidly watched as the ship inched ponderously toward the quayside.
并列句	During the next hour the sound of the engine died away to a quiet background rumble, voices shouted orders or queries, ropes were thrown, gangways lowered, hatches opened.
陈述句	Come on,  Lyra, said Farder Coram.
疑问句	Is everything packed?
并列句	Lyra's possessions, such as they were, had been packed ever since she'd woken up and seen the land.
并列句	All she had to do was run to the cabin and pick up the shopping bag, and she was ready.
并列句	The first thing she and Farder Coram did ashore was to visit the house of the witch consul.
并列句	It didn't take long to find it; the little town was clustered around the harbor, with the oratory and the governor's house the only buildings of any size.
并列句	The witch consul lived in a green-painted wooden house within sight of the sea, and when they rang the bell it jangled loudly in the quiet street.
并列句	A servant showed them into a little parlor and brought them coffee.
陈述句	Presently the consul himself came in to greet them.
并列句	He was a fat man with a florid face and a sober black suit, whose name was Martin Lanselius.
并列句	His dsmon was a little serpent, the same intense and brilliant green as his eyes, which were the only witchlike thing about him, though Lyra was not sure what she had been expecting a witch to look like.
疑问句	How can I help you, Farder Coram?
陈述句	he said.
陈述句	In two ways, Dr. Lanselius.
陈述句	First, I'm anxious to get in touch with a witch lady I met some years ago, in the fen country of Eastern Anglia.
陈述句	Her name is Serafina Pekkala.
陈述句	Dr. Lanselius made a note with a silver pencil.
疑问句	How long ago was your meeting with her?
陈述句	he said.
陈述句	Must be forty years.
并列句	But I think she would remember.
并列句	And what is the second way in which you seek my help?
陈述句	I'm representing a number of gyptian families who've lost children.
并列句	We've got reason to believe there's an organization capturing these children, ours and others, and bringing them to the North for some unknown purpose.
并列句	I'd like to know whether you or your people have heard of anything like this a going on.
陈述句	Dr. Lanselius sipped his coffee blandly.
陈述句	It's not impossible that notice of some such activity might have come our way, he said.
并列句	You realize, the relations between my people and the Northlanders are perfectly cordial.
陈述句	It would be difficult for me to justify disturbing them.
条件状语从句	Farder Coram nodded as if he understood very well.
陈述句	To be sure, he said.
并列句	And it wouldn't be necessary for me to ask you if I could get the information any other way.
陈述句	That was why I asked about the witch lady first.
条件状语从句	Now Dr. Lanselius nodded as if he understood.
并列句	Lyra watched this game with puzzlement and respect.
并列句	There were all kinds of things going on beneath it, and she saw that the witch consul was coming to a decision.
陈述句	Very well, he said.
并列句	Of course, that's true, and you'll realize that your name is not unknown to us, Farder Coram.
陈述句	Serafina Pekkala is queen of a witch clan in the region of Lake Enara.
陈述句	As for your other question, it is of course understood that this information is not reaching you through me.
陈述句	Quite so.
并列句	Well, in this very town there is a branch of an organization called the Northern Progress Exploration Company, which pretends to be searching for minerals, but which is really controlled by something called the General Oblation Board of London.
陈述句	This organization, I happen to know, imports children.
陈述句	This is not generally known in the town; the Norroway government is not officially aware of it.
陈述句	The children don't remain here long.
陈述句	They are taken some distance inland.
疑问句	Do you know where, Dr. Lanselius?
陈述句	No.
条件状语从句	I would tell you if I did.
并列句	And do you know what happens to them there?
陈述句	For the first time, Dr. Lanselius glanced at Lyra.
陈述句	She looked stolidly back.
并列句	The little green serpent daemon raised her head from the consul's collar and whispered tongue-flickeringly in his ear.
陈述句	The consul said, I have heard the phrase the M.aystadt process in connection with this matter.
陈述句	I think they use that in order to avoid calling what they do by its proper name.
并列句	I have also heard the word intercision, but what it refers to I could not say.
并列句	And are there any children in the town at the moment?
陈述句	said Farder Coram.
陈述句	He was stroking his daemon's fur as she sat alert in his lap.
陈述句	Lyra noticed that she had stopped purring.
陈述句	No, I think not, said Dr. Lanselius.
并列句	A group of about twelve arrived a week ago and moved out the day before yesterday.
感叹句	Ah!
疑问句	As recent as that?
陈述句	Then that gives us a bit of hope.
疑问句	How did they travel, Dr. Lanselius?
陈述句	By sledge.
并列句	And you have no idea where they went?
陈述句	Very little.
陈述句	It is not a subject we are interested in.
陈述句	Quite so.
并列句	Now, you've answered all my questions very fairly, sir, and here's just one more.
条件状语从句	If you were me, what question would you ask of the Consul of the Witches?
陈述句	For the first time Dr. Lanselius smiled.
陈述句	I would ask where I could obtain the services of an armored bear, he said.
并列句	Lyra sat up, and felt Pantalaimon's heart leap in her hands.
陈述句	I understood the armored bears to be in the service of the Oblation Board, said Farder Coram in surprise.
并列句	I mean, the Northern Progress Company, or whatever they're calling themselves.
陈述句	There is at least one who is not.
陈述句	You will find him at the sledge depot at the end of Langlokur Street.
并列句	He earns a living there at the moment, but such is his temper and the fear he engenders in the dogs, his employment might not last for long.
疑问句	Is he a renegade, then?
陈述句	It seems so.
陈述句	His name is lorek Byrnison.
并列句	You asked what I would ask, and I told you.
条件状语从句	Now here is what I would do: I would seize the chance to employ an armored bear, even if it were far more remote than this.
陈述句	Lyra could hardly sit still.
并列句	Farder Coram, however, knew the etiquette for meetings such as this, and took another spiced honey cake from the plate.
陈述句	While he ate it, Dr. Lanselius turned to Lyra.
疑问句	I understand that you are in possession of an alethiome-ter, he said, to her great surprise; for how could he have known that?
并列句	Yes, she said, and then, prompted by a nip from Pantalaimon, added, Would you like to look at it?
陈述句	I should like that very much.
并列句	She fished inelegantly in the oilskin pouch and handed him the velvet package.
并列句	He unfolded it and held it up with great care, gazing at the face like a Scholar gazing at a rare manuscript.
感叹句	How exquisite!
陈述句	he said.
并列句	I have seen one other example, but it was not so fine as this.
并列句	And do you possess the books of readings?
并列句	No, Lyra began, but before she could say any more, Farder Coram was speaking.
让步状语从句	No, the great pity is that although Lyra possesses the alethiometer itself, there's no means of reading it whatsoever, he said.
陈述句	It's just as much of a mystery as the pools of ink the Hindus use for reading the future.
并列句	And the nearest book of readings I know of is in the Abbey of St. Johann at Heidelberg.
陈述句	Lyra could see why he was saying this: he didn't want Dr. Lanselius to know of Lyra's power.
并列句	But she could also see something Farder Coram couldn't, which was the agitation of Dr. Lanselius's daemon, and she knew at once that it was no good to pretend.
并列句	So she said, Actually, I can read it, speaking half to Dr. Lanselius and half to Farder Coram, and it was the consul who responded.
陈述句	That is wise of you, he said.
疑问句	Where did you obtain this one?
陈述句	The Master of Jordan College in Oxford gave it to me, she said.
疑问句	Dr. Lanselius, do you know who made them?
陈述句	They are said to originate in the city of Prague, said the consul.
陈述句	The Scholar who invented the first alethiometer was apparently trying to discover a way of measuring the influences of the planets, according to the ideas of astrology.
并列句	He intended to make a device that would respond to the idea of Mars or Venus as a compass responds to the idea of North.
并列句	In that he failed, but the mechanism he invented was clearly responding to something, even if no one knew what it was.
并列句	And where did they get the symbols from?
陈述句	Oh, this was in the seventeenth century.
并列句	Symbols and emblems were everywhere.
并列句	Buildings and pictures were designed to be read like books.
条件状语从句	Everything stood for something else; if you had the right dictionary, you could read Nature itself.
陈述句	It was hardly surprising to find philosophers using the symbolism of their time to interpret knowledge that came from a mysterious source.
并列句	But, you know, they haven't been used seriously for two centuries or so.
并列句	He handed the instrument back to Lyra, and added: May I ask a question?
疑问句	Without the books of symbols, how do you read it?
并列句	I just make my mind go clear and then it's sort of like looking down into water.
原因状语从句	You got to let your eyes find the right level, because that's the only one that's in focus.
陈述句	Something like that, she said.
条件状语从句	I wonder if I might ask to see you do it?
陈述句	he said.
并列句	Lyra looked at Farder Coram, wanting to say yes but waiting for his approval.
陈述句	The old man nodded.
疑问句	What shall I ask?
陈述句	said Lyra.
疑问句	What are the intentions of the Tartars with regard to Kamchatka?
陈述句	That wasn't hard.
并列句	Lyra turned the hands to the camel, which meant Asia, which meant Tartars; to the cornucopia, for Kamchatka, where there were gold mines; and to the ant, which meant activity, which meant purpose and intention.
并列句	Then she sat still, letting her mind hold the three levels of meaning together in focus, and relaxed for the answer, which came almost at once.
并列句	The long needle trembled on the dolphin, the helmet, the baby, and the anchor, dancing between them and onto the crucible in a complicated pattern that Lyra's eyes followed without hesitation, but which was incomprehensible to the two men.
陈述句	When it had completed the movements several times, Lyra looked up.
并列句	She blinked once or twice as if she were coming out of a trance.
原因状语从句	They're going to pretend to attack it, but they're not really going to, because it's too far away and they'd be too stretched out, she said.
疑问句	Would you tell me how you read that?
陈述句	The dolphin, one of its deep-down meanings is playing, sort of like being playful, she explained.
原因状语从句	I know it's the fifteenth because it stopped fifteen times and it just got clear at that level but nowhere else.
并列句	And the helmet means war, and both together they mean pretend to go to war but not be serious.
原因状语从句	And the baby means-it means difficult-it'd be too hard for them to attack it, and the anchor says why, because they'd be stretched out as tight as an anchor rope.
陈述句	I just see it all like that, you see.
陈述句	Dr. Lanselius nodded.
陈述句	Remarkable, he said.
陈述句	I am very grateful.
陈述句	I shall not forget that.
并列句	Then he looked strangely at Farder Coram, and back at Lyra.
疑问句	Could I ask you for one more demonstration?
陈述句	he said.
并列句	If you look out of this window, you'll see a shed with forty or more sprays of cloud-pine hanging on the wall.
并列句	One of them has been used by Serafina Pekkala, and the others have not.
疑问句	Could you tell which is hers?
感叹句	Yeah!
并列句	said Lyra, always ready to show off, and she took the alethiometer and hurried out.
原因状语从句	She was eager to see cloud-pine, because the witches used it for flying, and she'd never seen any before.
并列句	The two men stood by the window and watched as she kicked her way through the snow, Pantalaimon bouncing beside her as a hare, to stand in front of the wooden shed, head down, manipulating the alethiometer.
并列句	After a few seconds she reached forward and unhesitatingly picked out one of the many sprays of pine and held it up.
陈述句	Dr. Lanselius nodded.
并列句	Lyra, intrigued and eager to fly, held it above her head and jumped, and ran about in the snow trying to be a witch.
并列句	The consul turned to Farder Coram and said: Do you realize who this child is?
陈述句	She's the daughter of Lord Asriel, said Farder Coram.
并列句	And her mother is Mrs. Coulter, of the Oblation Board.
并列句	And apart from that?
陈述句	The old gyptian had to shake his head.
陈述句	No, he said, I don't know any more.
并列句	But she's a strange innocent creature, and I wouldn't have her harmed for the world.
并列句	How she comes to read that instrument I couldn't guess, but I believe her when she talks of it.
疑问句	Why, Dr. Lanselius?
疑问句	What do you know about her?
陈述句	The witches have talked about this child for centuries past, said the consul.
原因状语从句	Because they live so close to the place where the veil between the worlds is thin, they hear immortal whispers from time to time, in the voices of those beings who pass between the worlds.
并列句	And they have spoken of a child such as this, who has a great destiny that can only be fulfilled elsewhere-not in this world, but far beyond.
陈述句	Without this child, we shall all die.
陈述句	So the witches say.
原因状语从句	But she must fulfill this destiny in ignorance of what she is doing, because only in her ignorance can we be saved.
疑问句	Do you understand that, Farder Coram?
陈述句	No, said Farder Coram, I'm unable to say that I do.
陈述句	What it means is that she must be free to make mistakes.
并列句	We must hope that she does not, but we can't guide her.
陈述句	I am glad to have seen this child before I die.
并列句	But how did you recognize her as being that particular child?
并列句	And what did you mean about the beings who pass between the worlds?
陈述句	I'm at a loss to understand you, Dr. Lanselius, for all that I judge you're an honest man....
并列句	But before the consul could answer, the door opened and Lyra came in bearing a little branch of pine.
感叹句	This is the one!
陈述句	she said.
并列句	I tested 'em all, and this is it, I'm sure.
并列句	But it won't fly for me.
陈述句	The consul said, Well, Lyra, that is remarkable.
并列句	You are lucky to have an instrument like that, and I wish you well with it.
陈述句	I would like to give you something to take away with you....
并列句	He took the spray and broke off a twig for her.
疑问句	Did she really fly with this?
陈述句	Lyra said.
陈述句	Yes, she did.
并列句	But then she is a witch, and you are not.
原因状语从句	I can't give you all of it, because I need it to contact her, but this will be enough.
陈述句	Look after it.
陈述句	Yes, I will, she said.
陈述句	Thank you.
并列句	And she tucked it into her purse beside the alethiometer.
并列句	Farder Coram touched the spray of pine as if for luck, and on his face was an expression Lyra had never seen before: almost a longing.
并列句	The consul showed them to the door, where he shook hands with Farder Coram, and shook Lyra's hand too.
并列句	I hope you find success, he said, and stood on his doorstep in the piercing cold to watch them up the little street.
陈述句	He knew the answer about the Tartars before I did, Lyra told Farder Coram.
并列句	The alethiometer told me, but I never said.
陈述句	It was the crucible.
陈述句	I expect he was testing you, child.
并列句	But you done right to be polite, being as we can't be sure what he knows already.
并列句	And that was a useful tip about the bear.
陈述句	I don't know how we would a heard otherwise.
并列句	They found their way to the depot, which was a couple of concrete warehouses in a scrubby area of waste ground where thin weeds grew between gray rocks and pools of icy mud.
原因状语从句	A surly man in an office told them that they could find the bear off duty at six, but they'd have to be quick, because he usually went straight to the yard behind Einarsson's Bar, where they gave him drink.
并列句	Then Farder Coram took Lyra to the best outfitter's in town and bought her some proper cold-weather clothing.
原因状语从句	They bought a parka made of reindeer skin, because reindeer hair is hollow and insulates well; and the hood was lined with wolverine fur, because that sheds the ice that forms when you breathe.
并列句	They bought underclothing and boot liners of reindeer calf skin, and silk gloves to go inside big fur mittens.
原因状语从句	The boots and mittens were made of skin from the reindeer's forelegs, because that is extra tough, and the boots were soled with the skin of the bearded seal, which is as tough as walrus hide, but lighter.
陈述句	Finally they bought a waterproof cape that enveloped her completely, made of semitransparent seal intestine.
并列句	With all that on, and a silk muffler around her neck and a woollen cap over her ears and the big hood pulled forward, she was uncomfortably warm; but they were going to much colder regions than this.
并列句	John Faa had been supervising the unloading of the ship, and was keen to hear about the witch consul's words, and even keener to learn of the bear.
陈述句	We'll go to him this very evening, he said.
疑问句	Have you ever spoken to such a creature, Farder Coram?
并列句	Yes, I have; and fought one, too, though not by myself, thank God.
陈述句	We must be ready to treat with him, John.
并列句	He'll ask a lot, I've no doubt, and be surly and difficult to manage; but we must have him.
陈述句	Oh, we must.
并列句	And what of your witch?
并列句	Well, she's a long way off, and a clan queen now, said Farder Coram.
并列句	I did hope it might be possible for a message to reach her, but it would take too long to wait for a reply.
陈述句	Ah, well.
陈述句	Now let me tell you what I've found, old friend.
陈述句	For John Faa had been fidgeting with impatience to tell them something.
并列句	He had met a prospector on the quayside, a New Dane from the country of Texas, and this man had a balloon, of all things.
陈述句	The expedition he'd been hoping to join had failed for lack of funds even before it had left Amsterdam, so he was stranded.
感叹句	Think what we might do with the help of an aeronaut, Farder Coram!
陈述句	said John Faa, rubbing his great hands together.
陈述句	I've engaged him to sign up with us.
陈述句	Seems to me we struck lucky a coming here.
并列句	Luckier still if we had a clear idea of where we were going, said Farder Coram, but nothing could damp John Faa's pleasure in being on campaign once more.
并列句	After darkness had fallen, and when the stores and equipment had all been safely unloaded and stood in waiting on the quay, Farder Coram and Lyra walked along the waterfront and looked for Einarsson's Bar.
并列句	They found it easily enough: a crude concrete shed with a red neon sign flashing irregularly over the door and the sound of loud voices through the condensation-frosted windows.
陈述句	A pitted alley beside it led to a sheet-metal gate into a rear yard, where a lean-to shed stood crazily over a floor of frozen mud.
并列句	Dim yellow light through the rear window of the bar showed a vast pale form crouching upright and gnawing at a haunch of meat which it held in both hands.
并列句	Lyra had an impression of bloodstained muzzle and face, small malevolent black eyes, and an immensity of dirty matted yellowish fur.
陈述句	As it gnawed, hideous growling, crunching, sucking noises came from it.
并列句	Farder Coram stood by the gate and called: lorek Byrnison!
陈述句	The bear stopped eating.
并列句	As far as they could tell, he was looking at them directly, but it was impossible to read any expression on his face.
陈述句	lorek Byrnison, said Farder Coram again.
疑问句	May I speak to you?
原因状语从句	Lyra's heart was thumping hard, because something in the bear's presence made her feel close to coldness, danger, brutal power, but a power controlled by intelligence; and not a human intelligence, nothing like a human, because of course bears had no daemons.
并列句	This strange hulking presence gnawing its meat was like nothing she had ever imagined, and she felt a profound admiration and pity for the lonely creature.
并列句	He dropped the reindeer leg in the dirt and slumped on all fours to the gate.
并列句	Then he reared up massively, ten feet or more high, as if to show how mighty he was, to remind them how useless the gate would be as a barrier, and he spoke to them from that height.
疑问句	Well?
疑问句	Who are you?
陈述句	His voice was so deep it seemed to shake the earth.
陈述句	The rank smell that came from his body was almost overpowering.
陈述句	I'm Farder Coram, from the gyptian people of Eastern Anglia.
并列句	And this little girl is Lyra Belacqua.
疑问句	What do you want?
陈述句	We want to offer you employment, lorek Byrnison.
陈述句	I am employed.
陈述句	The bear dropped on all fours again.
原因状语从句	It was very hard to detect any expressive tones in his voice, whether of irony or anger, because it was so deep and so flat.
疑问句	What do you do at the sledge depot?
陈述句	Farder Coram asked.
并列句	I mend broken machinery and articles of iron.
陈述句	I lift heavy objects.
疑问句	What kind of work is that for a panserbjorn?
陈述句	Paid work.
并列句	Behind the bear, the door of the bar opened a little way and a man put down a large earthenware jar before looking up to peer at them.
疑问句	Who's that?
陈述句	he said.
陈述句	Strangers, said the bear.
并列句	The bartender looked as if he was going to ask something more, but the bear lurched toward him suddenly and the man shut the door in alarm.
并列句	The bear hooked a claw through the handle of the jar and lifted it to his mouth.
陈述句	Lyra could smell the tang of the raw spirits that splashed out.
并列句	After swallowing several times, the bear put the jar down and turned back to gnaw his haunch of meat, heedless of Farder Coram and Lyra, it seemed; but then he spoke again.
疑问句	What work are you offering?
陈述句	Fighting, in all probability, said Farder Coram.
陈述句	We're moving north until we find a place where they've taken some children captive.
并列句	When we find it, we'll have to fight to get the children free; and then we'll bring them back.
并列句	And what will you pay?
陈述句	I don't know what to offer you, lorek Byrnison.
条件状语从句	If gold is desirable to you, we have gold.
陈述句	No good.
疑问句	What do they pay you at the sledge depot?
并列句	My keep here in meat and spirits.
并列句	Silence from the bear; and then he dropped the ragged bone and lifted the jar to his muzzle again, drinking the powerful spirits like water.
并列句	Forgive me for asking, lorek Byrnison, said Farder Coram, but you could live a free proud life on the ice hunting seals and walruses, or you could go to war and win great prizes.
并列句	What ties you to Trollesund and Einarsson's Bar?
陈述句	Lyra felt her skin shiver all over.
并列句	She would have thought a question like that, which was almost an insult, would enrage the great creature beyond reason, and she wondered at Farder Coram's courage in asking it.
并列句	lorek Byrnison put down his jar and came close to the gate to peer at the old man's face.
陈述句	Farder Coram didn't flinch.
陈述句	I know the people you are seeking, the child cutters, the bear said.
陈述句	They left town the day before yesterday to go north with more children.
原因状语从句	No one will tell you about them; they pretend not to see, because the child cutters bring money and business.
陈述句	Now, I don't like the child cutters, so I shall answer you politely.
原因状语从句	I stay here and drink spirits because the men here took my armor away, and without that, I can hunt seals but I can't go to war; and I am an armored bear; war is the sea I swim in and the air I breathe.
并列句	The men of this town gave me spirits and let me drink till I was asleep, and then they took my armor away from me.
条件状语从句	If I knew where they keep it, I would tear down the town to get it back.
条件状语从句	If you want my service, the price is this: get me back my armor.
并列句	Do that, and I shall serve you in your campaign, either until I am dead or until you have a victory.
陈述句	The price is my armor.
并列句	I want it back, and then I shall never need spirits again.
并列句	ELEVEN   ARMOR     When they returned to the ship, Farder Coram and John Faa and the other leaders spent a long time in conference in the saloon, and Lyra went to her cabin to consult the alethiome-ter.
并列句	Within five minutes she knew exactly where the bear's armor was, and why it would be difficult to get it back.
并列句	She wondered whether to go to the saloon and tell John Faa and the others, but decided that they'd ask her if they wanted to know.
陈述句	Perhaps they knew already.
并列句	She lay on her bunk thinking of that savage mighty bear, and the careless way he drank his fiery spirit, and the loneliness of him in his dirty lean-to.
感叹句	How different it was to be human, with one's daemon always there to talk to!
并列句	In the silence of the still ship, without the continual creak of metal and timber or the rumble of the engine or the rush of water along the side, Lyra gradually fell asleep, with Pantalaimon on her pillow sleeping too.
陈述句	She was dreaming of her great imprisoned father when suddenly, for no reason at all, she woke up.
陈述句	She had no idea what time it was.
并列句	There was a faint light in the cabin that she took for moonlight, and it showed her new cold-weather furs that lay stiffly in the corner of the cabin.
陈述句	No sooner did she see them than she longed to try them on again.
并列句	Once they were on, she had to go out on deck, and a minute later she opened the door at the top of the compan-ionway and stepped out.
陈述句	At once she saw that something strange was happening in the sky.
并列句	She thought it was clouds, moving and trembling under a nervous agitation, but Pantalaimon whispered: The Aurora!
陈述句	Her wonder was so strong that she had to clutch the rail to keep from falling.
陈述句	The sight filled the northern sky; the immensity of it was scarcely conceivable.
并列句	As if from Heaven itself, great curtains of delicate light hung and trembled.
并列句	Pale green and rose-pink, and as transparent as the most fragile fabric, and at the bottom edge a profound and fiery crimson like the fires of Hell, they swung and shimmered loosely with more grace than the most skillful dancer.
陈述句	Lyra thought she could even hear them: a vast distant whispering swish.
陈述句	In the evanescent delicacy she felt something as profound as she'd felt close to the bear.
并列句	She was moved by it; it was so beautiful it was almost holy; she felt tears prick her eyes, and the tears splintered the light even further into prismatic rainbows.
陈述句	It wasn't long before she found herself entering the same kind of trance as when she consulted the alethiometer.
陈述句	Perhaps, she thought calmly, whatever moves the alethiometer's needle is making the Aurora glow too.
陈述句	It might even be Dust itself.
并列句	She thought that without noticing that she'd thought it, and she soon forgot it, and only remembered it much later.
并列句	And as she gazed, the image of a city seemed to form itself behind the veils and streams of translucent color: towers and domes, honey-colored temples and colonnades, broad boulevards and sunlit parkland.
并列句	Looking at it gave her a sense of vertigo, as if she were looking not up but down, and across a gulf so wide that nothing could ever pass over it.
陈述句	It was a whole universe away.
原因状语从句	But something was moving across it, and as she tried to focus her eyes on the movement, she felt faint and dizzy, because the little thing moving wasn't part of the Aurora or of the other universe behind it.
陈述句	It was in the sky over the roofs of the town.
并列句	When she could see it clearly, she had come fully awake and the sky city was gone.
并列句	The flying thing came closer and circled the ship on outspread wings.
并列句	Then it glided down and landed with brisk sweeps of its powerful pinions, and came to a halt on the wooden deck a few yards from Lyra.
陈述句	In the Aurora's light she saw a great bird, a beautiful gray goose whose head was crowned with a flash of pure white.
并列句	And yet it wasn't a bird: it was a daemon, though there was no one in sight but Lyra herself.
陈述句	The idea filled her with sickly fear.
疑问句	The bird said: Where is Farder Coram?
并列句	And suddenly Lyra realized who it must be.
陈述句	This was the daemon of Serafina Pekkala, the clan queen, Farder Coram's witch friend.
并列句	She stammered to reply: I-he's-I'll go and get him.... She turned and scampered down the companionway to the cabin Farder Coram occupied, and opened the door to speak into the darkness: Farder Coram!
感叹句	The witch's daemon's come!
感叹句	He's waiting on the deck!
陈述句	He flew here all by hisself-I seen him coming in the sky- The old man said, Ask him to wait on the afterdeck, child.
并列句	The goose made his stately way to the stern of the ship, where he looked around, elegant and wild simultaneously, and a cause of fascinated terror to Lyra, who felt as though she were entertaining a ghost.
陈述句	Then Farder Coram came up, wrapped in his cold-weather gear, closely followed by John Faa.
并列句	Both old men bowed respectfully, and their daemons also acknowledged the visitor.
陈述句	Greetings, said Farder Coram.
并列句	And I'm happy and proud to see you again, Kaisa.
并列句	Now, would you like to come inside, or would you prefer to stay out here in the open?
陈述句	I would rather stay outside, thank you, Farder Coram.
疑问句	Are you warm enough for a while?
并列句	Witches and their daemons felt no cold, but they were aware that other humans did.
并列句	Farder Coram assured him that they were well wrapped up, and said, How is Serafina Pekkala?
并列句	She sends her greetings to you, Farder Coram, and she is well and strong.
疑问句	Who are these two people?
陈述句	Farder Coram introduced them both.
陈述句	The goose daemon looked hard at Lyra.
陈述句	I have heard of this child, he said.
陈述句	She is talked about among witches.
疑问句	So you have come to make war?
陈述句	Not war, Kaisa.
陈述句	We are going to free the children taken from us.
并列句	And I hope the witches will help.
陈述句	Not all of them will.
陈述句	Some clans are working with the Dust hunters.
疑问句	Is that what you call the Oblation Board?
陈述句	I don't know what this board may be.
陈述句	They are Dust hunters.
陈述句	They came to our regions ten years ago with philosophical instruments.
并列句	They paid us to allow them to set up stations in our lands, and they treated us with courtesy.
疑问句	What is this Dust?
陈述句	It comes from the sky.
陈述句	Some say it has always been there, some say it is newly falling.
并列句	What is certain is that when people become aware of it, a great fear comes over them, and they'll stop at nothing to discover what it is.
并列句	But it is not of any concern to witches.
并列句	And where are they now, these Dust hunters?
陈述句	Four days northeast of here, at a place called Bolvangar.
原因状语从句	Our clan made no agreement with them, and because of our longstanding obligation to you, Farder Coram, I have come to show you how to find these Dust hunters.
并列句	Farder Coram smiled, and John Faa clapped his great hands together in satisfaction.
陈述句	Thank you kindly, sir, he said to the goose.
并列句	But tell us this: do you know anything more about these Dust hunters?
疑问句	What do they do at this Bolvangar?
并列句	They have put up buildings of metal and concrete, and some underground chambers.
陈述句	They burn coal spirit, which they bring in at great expense.
并列句	We don't know what they do, but there is an air of hatred and fear over the place and for miles around.
陈述句	Witches can see these things where other humans can't.
陈述句	Animals keep away too.
并列句	No birds fly there; lemmings and foxes have fled.
陈述句	Hence the name Bolvangar: the fields of evil.
陈述句	They don't call it that.
陈述句	They call it 'the station.'
并列句	But to everyone else it is Bolvangar.
并列句	And how are they defended?
陈述句	They have a company of Northern Tartars armed with rifles.
原因状语从句	They are good soldiers, but they lack practice, because no one has ever attacked the settlement since it was built.
陈述句	Then there is a wire fence around the compound, which is filled with anbaric force.
原因状语从句	There may be other means of defense that we don't know about, because as I say they have no interest for us.
并列句	Lyra was bursting to ask a question, and the goose dasmon knew it and looked at her as if giving permission.
疑问句	Why do the witches talk about me?
陈述句	she said.
原因状语从句	Because of your father, and his knowledge of the other worlds, the daemon replied.
陈述句	That surprised all three of them.
并列句	Lyra looked at Farder Coram, who looked back in mild wonder, and at John Faa, whose expression was troubled.
疑问句	Other worlds?
陈述句	John Faa said.
并列句	Pardon me, sir, but what worlds would those be?
疑问句	Do you mean the stars?
陈述句	Indeed no.
疑问句	Perhaps the world of spirits?
陈述句	said Farder Coram.
陈述句	Nor that.
疑问句	Is it the city in the lights?
陈述句	said Lyra.
疑问句	It is, en't it?
陈述句	The goose turned his stately head toward her.
并列句	His eyes were black, surrounded by a thin line of pure sky-blue, and their gaze was intense.
陈述句	Yes, he said.
陈述句	Witches have known of the other worlds for thousands of years.
陈述句	You can see them sometimes in the Northern Lights.
并列句	They aren't part of this universe at all; even the furthest stars are part of this universe, but the lights show us a different universe entirely.
并列句	Not further away, but interpenetrating with this one.
陈述句	Here, on this deck, millions of other universes exist, unaware of one another....
并列句	He raised his wings and spread them wide before folding them again.
并列句	There, he said, I have just brushed ten million other worlds, and they knew nothing of it.
并列句	We are as close as a heartbeat, but we can never touch or see or hear these other worlds except in the Northern Lights.
并列句	And why there?
陈述句	said Farder Coram.
原因状语从句	Because the charged particles in the Aurora have the property of making the matter of this world thin, so that we can see through it for a brief time.
并列句	Witches have always known this, but we seldom speak of it.
陈述句	My father believes in it, Lyra said.
原因状语从句	I know because I heard him talking and showing pictures of the Aurora.
疑问句	Is this anything to do with Dust?
陈述句	said John Faa.
疑问句	Who can say?
陈述句	said the goose daemon.
条件状语从句	All I can tell you is that the Dust hunters are as frightened of it as if it were deadly poison.
陈述句	That is why they imprisoned Lord Asriel.
并列句	But why?
陈述句	Lyra said.
并列句	They think he intends to use Dust in some way in order to make a bridge between this world and the world beyond the Aurora.
陈述句	There was a lightness in Lyra's head.
并列句	She heard Farder Coram say, And does he?
陈述句	Yes, said the goose daemon.
原因状语从句	They don't believe he can, because they think he is mad to believe in the other worlds in the first place.
并列句	But it is true: that is his intention.
并列句	And he is so powerful a figure that they feared he would upset their own plans, so they made a pact with the armored bears to capture him and keep him imprisoned in the fortress of Svalbard, out of the way.
陈述句	Some say they helped the new bear king to gain his throne, as part of the bargain.
疑问句	Lyra said, Do the witches want him to make this bridge?
并列句	Are they on his side or against him?
陈述句	That is a question with too complicated an answer.
陈述句	Firstly, the witches are not united.
陈述句	There are differences of opinion among us.
并列句	Secondly, Lord Asriel's bridge will have a bearing on a war being waged at the present between some witches and various other forces, some in the spirit world.
条件状语从句	Possession of the bridge, if it ever existed, would give a huge advantage to whoever held it.
并列句	Thirdly, Serafina Pekkala's clan-my clan-is not yet part of any alliance, though great pressure is being put on us to declare for one side or another.
并列句	You see, these are questions of high politics, and not easily answered.
疑问句	What about the bears?
陈述句	said Lyra.
疑问句	Whose side are they on?
陈述句	On the side of anyone who pays them.
陈述句	They have no interest whatever in these questions; they have no daemons; they are unconcerned about human problems.
并列句	At least, that is how bears used to be, but we have heard that their new king is intent on changing their old ways....At any rate, the Dust hunters have paid them to imprison Lord Asriel, and they will hold him on Svalbard until the last drop of blood drains from the body of the last bear alive.
并列句	But not all bears!
陈述句	Lyra said.
陈述句	There's one who en't on Svalbard at all.
并列句	He's an outcast bear, and he's going to come with us.
陈述句	The goose gave Lyra another of his piercing looks.
陈述句	This time she could feel his cold surprise.
并列句	Farder Coram shifted uncomfortably, and said, The fact is, Lyra, I don't think he is.
陈述句	We heard he's serving out a term as an indentured laborer; he en't free, as we thought he might be, he's under sentence.
并列句	Till he's discharged he won't be free to come, armor or no armor; and he won't never have that back, either.
并列句	But he said they tricked him!
并列句	They made him drunk and stole it away!
陈述句	We heard a different story, said John Faa.
陈述句	He's a dangerous rogue, is what we heard.
陈述句	If- Lyra was passionate; she could hardly speak for indignation.
陈述句	-if the alethiometer says something, I know it's true.
并列句	And I asked it, and it said that he was telling the truth, they did trick him, and they're telling lies and not him.
感叹句	I believe him, Lord Faa!
并列句	Farder Coram-you saw him too, and you believe him, don't you?
陈述句	I thought I did, child.
陈述句	I en't so certain of things as you are.
并列句	But what are they afraid of?
疑问句	Do they think he's going to go round killing people as soon's he gets his armor on?
感叹句	He could kill dozens of 'em now!
陈述句	He has done, said John Faa.
条件状语从句	Well, if not dozens, then some.
陈述句	When they first took his armor away, he went a rampaging round looking for it.
并列句	He tore open the police house and the bank and I don't know where else, and there's at least two men who died.
原因状语从句	The only reason they didn't shoot to kill him is because of his wondrous skill with metals; they wanted to use him like a laborer.
感叹句	Like a slave!
陈述句	Lyra said hotly.
感叹句	They hadn't got the right!
并列句	Be that as it may, they might have shot him for the killings he done, but they didn't.
并列句	And they bound him over to labor in the town's interest until he's paid off the damage and the blood money.
并列句	John, said Farder Coram, I don't know how you feel, but it's my belief they'll never let him have that armor back.
陈述句	The longer they keep him, the more angry he'll be when he gets it.
并列句	But if we get his armor back, he'll come with us and never bother 'em again, said Lyra.
陈述句	I promise, Lord Faa.
并列句	And how are we going to do that?
感叹句	I know where it is!
并列句	There was a silence, in which they all three became aware of the witch's daemon and his fixed stare at Lyra.
并列句	All three turned to him, and their own daemons too, who had until then affected the extreme politeness of keeping their eyes modestly away from this singular creature, here without his body.
陈述句	You won't be surprised, said the goose, to know that the alethiometer is one other reason the witches are interested in you, Lyra.
陈述句	Our consul told us about your visit this morning.
陈述句	I believe it was Dr. Lanselius who told you about the bear.
陈述句	Yes, it was, said John Faa.
并列句	And she and Farder Coram went theirselves and talked to him.
并列句	I daresay what Lyra says is true, but if we go breaking the law of these people we'll only get involved in a quarrel with them, and what we ought to be doing is pushing on towards this Bolvangar, bear or no bear.
并列句	Ah, but you en't seen him, John, said Farder Coram.
并列句	And I do believe Lyra.
陈述句	We could promise on his behalf, maybe.
陈述句	He might make all the difference.
疑问句	What do you think, sir?
陈述句	said John Faa to the witch's daemon.
陈述句	We have few dealings with bears.
陈述句	Their desires are as strange to us as ours are to them.
条件状语从句	If this bear is an outcast, he might be less reliable than they are said to be.
陈述句	You must decide for yourselves.
陈述句	We will, said John Faa firmly.
并列句	But now, sir, can you tell us how to get to Bolvangar from here?
陈述句	The goose daemon began to explain.
并列句	He spoke of valleys and hills, of the tree line and the tundra, of star sightings.
并列句	Lyra listened awhile, and then lay back in the deck chair with Pantalaimon curled around her neck, and thought of the grand vision the goose daemon had brought with him.
感叹句	A bridge between two worlds...This was far more splendid than anything she could have hoped for!
并列句	And only her great father could have conceived it.
并列句	As soon as they had rescued the children, she would go to Svalbard with the bear and take Lord Asriel the alethiometer, and use it to help set him free; and they'd build the bridge together, and be the first across....
原因状语从句	Sometime in the night John Faa must have carried Lyra to her bunk, because that was where she awoke.
陈述句	The dim sun was as high in the sky as it was going to get, only a hand's breadth above the horizon, so it must be nearly noon, she thought.
陈述句	Soon, when they moved further north, there would be no sun at all.
并列句	She dressed quickly and ran on deck to find nothing very much happening.
并列句	All the stores had been unloaded, sledges and dog teams had been hired and were waiting to go; everything was ready and nothing was moving.
并列句	Most of the gyp-tians were sitting in a smoke-filled cafe facing the water, eating spice cakes and drinking strong sweet coffee at the long wooden tables under the fizz and crackle of some ancient anbaric lights.
疑问句	Where's Lord Faa?
并列句	she said, sitting down with Tony Costa and his friends.
并列句	And Farder Coram?
疑问句	Are they getting the bear's armor for him?
陈述句	They're a talking to the sysselman.
陈述句	That's their word for governor.
疑问句	You seen this bear, then, Lyra?
感叹句	Yeah!
并列句	she said, and explained all about him.
并列句	As she talked, someone else pulled a chair up and joined the group at the table.
疑问句	So you've spoken to old lorek?
陈述句	he said.
陈述句	She looked at the newcomer with surprise.
并列句	He was a tall, lean man with a thin black moustache and narrow blue eyes, and a perpetual expression of distant and sardonic amusement.
并列句	She felt strongly about him at once, but she wasn't sure whether it was liking she felt, or dislike.
并列句	His daemon was a shabby hare as thin and tough-looking as he was.
并列句	He held out his hand and she shook it warily.
陈述句	Lee Scoresby, he said.
感叹句	The aeronaut!
陈述句	she exclaimed.
疑问句	Where's your balloon?
疑问句	Can I go up in it?
陈述句	It's packed away right now, miss.
陈述句	You must be the famous Lyra.
疑问句	How did you get on with lorek Byrnison?
疑问句	You know him?
陈述句	I fought beside him in the Tunguska campaign.
陈述句	Hell, I've known lorek for years.
并列句	Bears are difficult critters no matter what, but he's a problem, and no mistake.
疑问句	Say, are any of you gentlemen in the mood for a game of hazard?
陈述句	A pack of cards had appeared from nowhere in his hand.
陈述句	He riffled them with a snapping noise.
并列句	Now I've heard of the card power of your people, Lee Scoresby was saying, cutting and folding the cards over and over with one hand and fishing a cigar out of his breast pocket with the other, and I thought you wouldn't object to giving a simple Texan traveler the chance to joust with your skill and daring on the field of pasteboard combat.
疑问句	What do you say, gentlemen?
并列句	Gyptians prided themselves on their ability with cards, and several of the men looked interested and pulled their chairs up.
并列句	While they were agreeing with Lee Scoresby what to play and for what stakes, his daemon flicked her ears at Pantalaimon, who understood and leaped to her side lightly as a squirrel.
并列句	She was speaking for Lyra's ears too, of course, and Lyra heard her say quietly, Go straight to the bear and tell him direct.
陈述句	As soon as they know what's going on, they'll move his armor somewhere else.
并列句	Lyra got up, taking her spice cake with her, and no one noticed; Lee Scoresby was already dealing the cards, and every suspicious eye was on his hands.
陈述句	In the dull light, fading through an endless afternoon, she found her way to the sledge depot.
并列句	It was something she knew she had to do, but she felt uneasy about it, and afraid, too.
并列句	Outside the largest of the concrete sheds the great bear was working, and Lyra stood by the open gate to watch.
并列句	lorek Byrnison was dismantling a gas-engined tractor that had crashed; the metal covering of the engine was twisted and buckled and one runner bent upward.
并列句	The bear lifted the metal off as if it were cardboard, and turned it this way and that in his great hands, seeming to test it for some quality or other, before setting a rear paw on one corner and then bending the whole sheet in such a way that the dents sprang out and the shape was restored.
并列句	Leaning it against the wall, he lifted the massive weight of the tractor with one paw and laid it on its side before bending to examine the crumpled runner.
陈述句	As he did so, he caught sight of Lyra.
原因状语从句	She felt a bolt of cold fear strike at her, because he was so massive and so alien.
并列句	She was gazing through the chain-link fence about forty yards from him, and she thought how he could clear the distance in a bound or two and sweep the wire aside like a cobweb, and she almost turned and ran away; but Pantalaimon said, Stop!
并列句	Let me go and talk to him.
并列句	He was a tern, and before she could answer he'd flown off the fence and down to the icy ground beyond it.
并列句	There was an open gate a little way along, and Lyra could have followed him, but she hung back uneasily.
并列句	Pantalaimon looked at her, and then became a badger.
陈述句	She knew what he was doing.
并列句	Daemons could move no more than a few yards from their humans, and if she stood by the fence and he remained a bird, he wouldn't get near the bear; so he was going to pull.
并列句	She felt angry and miserable.
并列句	His badger claws dug into the earth and he walked forward.
并列句	It was such a strange tormenting feeling when your daemon was pulling at the link between you; part physical pain deep in the chest, part intense sadness and love.
并列句	And she knew it was the same for him.
陈述句	Everyone tested it when they were growing up: seeing how far they could pull apart, coming back with intense relief.
陈述句	He tugged a little harder.
感叹句	Don't, Pan!
并列句	But he didn't stop.
陈述句	The bear watched, motionless.
并列句	The pain in Lyra's heart grew more and more unbearable, and a sob of longing rose in her throat.
并列句	Pan- Then she was through the gate, scrambling over the icy mud toward him, and he turned into a wildcat and sprang up into her arms, and they were clinging together tightly with little shaky sounds of unhappiness coming from them both.
并列句	I thought you really would- No- I couldn't believe how much it hurt- And then she brushed the tears away angrily and sniffed hard.
并列句	He nestled in her arms, and she knew she would rather die than let them be parted and face that sadness again; it would send her mad with grief and terror.
条件状语从句	If she died, they'd still be together, like the Scholars in the crypt at Jordan.
并列句	Then girl and daemon looked up at the solitary bear.
陈述句	He had no daemon.
陈述句	He was alone, always alone.
并列句	She felt such a stir of pity and gentleness for him that she almost reached out to touch his matted pelt, and only a sense of courtesy toward those cold ferocious eyes prevented her.
陈述句	lorek Byrnison, she said.
疑问句	Well?
并列句	Lord Faa and Farder Coram have gone to try and get your armor for you.
并列句	He didn't move or speak.
陈述句	It was clear what he thought of their chances.
并列句	I know where it is, though, she said, and if I told you, maybe you could get it by yourself, I don't know.
疑问句	How do you know where it is?
陈述句	I got a symbol reader.
陈述句	I think I ought to tell you, lorek Byrnison, seeing as they tricked you out of it in the first place.
陈述句	I don't think that's right.
陈述句	They shouldn't've done that.
并列句	Lord Faa's going to argue with the sysselman, but probably they won't let you have it whatever he says.
并列句	So if I tell you, will you come with us and help rescue the kids from Bolvangar?
陈述句	Yes.
并列句	I... She didn't mean to be nosy, but she couldn't help being curious.
疑问句	She said, Why don't you just make some more armor out of this metal here, lorek Byrnison?
原因状语从句	Because it's worthless.
并列句	Look, he said, and, lifting the engine cover with one paw, he extended a claw on the other hand and ripped right through it like a can opener.
陈述句	My armor is made of sky iron, made for me.
陈述句	A bear's armor is his soul, just as your daemon is your soul.
陈述句	You might as well take him away -indicating Pantalaimon-and replace him with a doll full of sawdust.
陈述句	That is the difference.
疑问句	Now, where is my armor?
陈述句	Listen, you got to promise not to take vengeance.
并列句	They done wrong taking it, but you just got to put up with that.
陈述句	All right.
陈述句	No vengeance afterwards.
并列句	But no holding back as I take it, either.
条件状语从句	If they fight, they die.
陈述句	It's hidden in the cellar of the priest's house, she told him.
并列句	He thinks there's a spirit in it, and he's been a trying to conjure it out.
并列句	But that's where it is.
并列句	He stood high up on his hind legs and looked west, so that the last of the sun colored his face a creamy brilliant yellow white amid the gloom.
陈述句	She could feel the power of the great creature coming off him like waves of heat.
陈述句	I must work till sunset, he said.
陈述句	I gave my word this morning to the master here.
陈述句	I still owe a few minutes' work.
原因状语从句	The sun's set where I am, she pointed out, because from her point of view it had vanished behind the rocky headland to the southwest.
陈述句	He dropped to all fours.
陈述句	It's true, he said, with his face now in shadow like hers.
疑问句	What's your name, child?
陈述句	Lyra Belacqua.
陈述句	Then I owe you a debt, Lyra Belacqua, he said.
并列句	He turned and lurched away, padding so swiftly across the freezing ground that Lyra couldn't keep up, even running.
并列句	She did run, though, and Pantalaimon flew up as a seagull to watch where the bear went and called down to tell her where to follow.
并列句	Iorek Byrnison bounded out of the depot and along the narrow street before turning into the main street of the town, past the courtyard of the sysselman's residence where a flag hung in the still air and a sentry marched stiffly up and down, down the hill past the end of the street where the witch consul lived.
并列句	The sentry by this time had realized what was happening, and was trying to gather his wits, but lorek Byrnison was already turning a corner near the harbor.
并列句	People stopped to watch or scuttled out of his careering way.
并列句	The sentry fired two shots in the air, and set off down the hill after the bear, spoiling the effect by skidding on the icy slope and only regaining his balance after seizing the nearest railings.
陈述句	Lyra was not far behind.
并列句	As she passed the syssel-man's house, she was aware of a number of figures coming out into the courtyard to see what was going on, and thought she saw Farder Coram among them; but then she was past, hurtling down the street toward the corner where the sentry was already turning to follow the bear.
并列句	The priest's house was older than most, and made of costly bricks.
并列句	Three steps led up to the front door, which was now hanging in matchwood splinters, and from inside the house came screams and the crashing and tearing of more wood.
并列句	The sentry hesitated outside, his rifle at the ready; but then as passers-by began to gather and people looked out of windows from across the street, he realized that he had to act, and fired a shot into the air before running in.
陈述句	A moment later, the whole house seemed to shake.
并列句	Glass broke in three windows and a tile slid off the roof, and then a maidservant ran out, terrified, her clucking hen of a daemon flapping after her.
并列句	Another shot came from inside the house, and then a full-throated roar made the servant scream.
并列句	As if fired from a cannon, the priest himself came hurtling out, with his pelican daemon in a wild flutter of feathers and injured pride.
并列句	Lyra heard orders shouted, and turned to see a squad of armed policemen hurrying around the corner, some with pistols and some with rifles, and not far behind them came John Faa and the stout, fussy figure of the sysselman.
陈述句	A rending, splintering sound made them all look back at the house.
并列句	A window at ground level, obviously opening on a cellar, was being wrenched apart with a crash of glass and a screech of tearing wood.
并列句	The sentry who'd followed lorek Byrnison into the house came running out and stood to face the cellar window, rifle at his shoulder; and then the window tore open completely, and out climbed lorek Byrnison, the bear in armor.
陈述句	Without it, he was formidable.
陈述句	With it, he was terrifying.
并列句	It was rust-red, and crudely riveted together: great sheets and plates of dented discolored metal that scraped and screeched as they rode over one another.
并列句	The helmet was pointed like his muzzle, with slits for eyes, and it left the lower part of his jaw bare for tearing and biting.
并列句	The sentry fired several shots, and the policemen leveled their weapons too, but lorek Byrnison merely shook the bullets off like raindrops, and lunged forward in a screech and clang of metal before the sentry could escape, and knocked him to the ground.
并列句	His daemon, a husky dog, darted at the bear's throat, but lorek Byrnison took no more notice of him than he would of a fly, and dragging the sentry to him with one vast paw, he bent and enclosed his head in his jaws.
并列句	Lyra could see exactly what would happen next: he'd crush the man's skull like an egg, and there would follow a bloody fight, more deaths, and more delay; and they would never get free, with or without the bear.
并列句	Without even thinking, she darted forward and put her hand on the one vulnerable spot in the bear's armor, the gap that appeared between the helmet and the great plate over his shoulders when he bent his head, where she could see the yellow-white fur dimly between the rusty edges of metal.
并列句	She dug her fingers in, and Pantalaimon instantly flew to the same spot and became a wildcat, crouched to defend her; but lorek Byrnison was still, and the riflemen held their fire.
感叹句	lorek!
陈述句	she said in a fierce undertone.
感叹句	Listen!
陈述句	You owe me a debt, right.
陈述句	Well, now you can repay it.
陈述句	Do as I ask.
陈述句	Don't fight these men.
并列句	Just turn around and walk away with me.
陈述句	We want you, lorek, you can't stay here.
并列句	Just come down to the harbor with me and don't even look back.
并列句	Farder Coram and Lord Faa, let them do the talking, they'll make it all right.
并列句	Leave go this man and come away with me....
陈述句	The bear slowly opened his jaws.
并列句	The sentry's head, bleeding and wet and ash-pale, fell to the ground as he fainted, and his dsmon set about calming and gentling him as the bear stepped away beside Lyra.
陈述句	No one else moved.
并列句	They watched the bear turn away from his victim at the bidding of the girl with the cat daemon, and then they shuffled aside to make room as lorek Byrnison padded heavily through the midst of them at Lyra's side and made for the harbor.
并列句	Her mind was all on him, and she didn't see the confusion behind her, the fear and the anger that rose up safely when he was gone.
并列句	She walked with him, and Pantalaimon padded ahead of them both as if to clear the way.
并列句	When they reached the harbor, lorek Byrnison dipped his head and unfastened the helmet with a claw, letting it clang on the frozen ground.
并列句	Gyptians came out of the cafe, having sensed that something was going on, and watched in the gleam of the anbaric lights on the ship's deck as lorek Byrnison shrugged off the rest of his armor and left it in a heap on the quayside.
并列句	Without a word to anyone he padded to the water and slipped into it without a ripple, and vanished.
疑问句	What's happened?
并列句	said Tony Costa, hearing the indignant voices from the streets above, as the townsfolk and the police made their way to the harbor.
陈述句	Lyra told him, as clearly as she could.
并列句	But where's he gone now?
陈述句	he said.
疑问句	He en't just left his armor on the ground?
感叹句	They'll have it back, as soon's they get here!
并列句	Lyra was afraid they might, too, for around the corner came the first policemen, and then more, and then the sysselman and the priest and twenty or thirty onlookers, with John Faa and Farder Coram trying to keep up.
并列句	But when they saw the group on the quayside they stopped, for someone else had appeared.
并列句	Sitting on the bear's armor with one ankle resting on the opposite knee was the long-limbed form of Lee Scoresby, and in his hand was the longest pistol Lyra had ever seen, casually pointing at the ample stomach of the sysselman.
陈述句	Seems to me you ain't taken very good care of my friend's armor, he said conversationally.
感叹句	Why, look at the rust!
并列句	And I wouldn't be surprised to find moths in it, too.
并列句	Now you just stand where you are, still and easy, and don't anybody move till the bear comes back with some lubrication.
并列句	Or I guess you could all go home and read the newspaper.
陈述句	'S up to you.
感叹句	There he is!
陈述句	said Tony, pointing to a ramp at the far end of the quay, where lorek Byrnison was emerging from the water, dragging something dark with him.
陈述句	Once he was up on the quayside he shook himself, sending great sheets of water flying in all directions, till his fur was standing up thickly again.
并列句	Then he bent to take the black object in his teeth once more and dragged it along to where his armor lay.
陈述句	It was a dead seal.
并列句	lorek, said the aeronaut, standing up lazily and keeping his pistol firmly fixed on the sysselman.
陈述句	Howdy.
并列句	The bear looked up and growled briefly, before ripping the seal open with one claw.
并列句	Lyra watched fascinated as he laid the skin out flat and tore off strips of blubber, which he then rubbed all over his armor, packing it carefully into the places where the plates moved over one another.
疑问句	Are you with these people?
陈述句	the bear said to Lee Scoresby as he worked.
陈述句	Sure.
陈述句	I guess we're both hired hands, lorek.
疑问句	Where's your balloon?
陈述句	said Lyra to the Texan.
陈述句	Packed away in two sledges, he said.
陈述句	Here comes the boss.
并列句	John Faa and Farder Coram, together with the sysselman, came down the quay with four armed policemen.
感叹句	Bear!
陈述句	said the sysselman, in a high, harsh voice.
陈述句	For now, you are allowed to depart in the company of these people.
并列句	But let me tell you that if you appear within the town limits again, you will be treated mercilessly.
并列句	lorek Byrnison took not the slightest notice, but continued to rub the seal blubber all over his armor, the care and attention he was paying the task reminding Lyra of her own devotion to Pantalaimon.
陈述句	Just as the bear had said: the armor was his soul.
并列句	The sysselman and the policemen withdrew, and slowly the other townspeople turned and drifted away, though a few remained to watch.
并列句	John Faa put his hands to his mouth and called: Gyptians!
陈述句	They were all ready to move.
陈述句	They had been itching to get under way ever since they had disembarked; the sledges were packed, the dog teams were in their traces.
陈述句	John Faa said, Time to move out, friends.
并列句	We're all assembled now, and the road lies open.
疑问句	Mr. Scoresby, you all a loaded?
陈述句	Ready to go, Lord Faa.
并列句	And you, lorek Byrnison?
陈述句	When I am clad, said the bear.
陈述句	He had finished oiling the armor.
并列句	Not wanting to waste the seal meat, he lifted the carcass in his teeth and flipped it onto the back of Lee Scoresby's larger sledge before donning the armor.
并列句	It was astonishing to see how lightly he dealt with it: the sheets of metal were almost an inch thick in places, and yet he swung them round and into place as if they were silk robes.
并列句	It took him less than a minute, and this time there was no harsh scream of rust.
陈述句	So in less than half an hour, the expedition was on its way northward.
并列句	Under a sky peopled with millions of stars and a glaring moon, the sledges bumped and clattered over the ruts and stones until they reached clear snow at the edge of town.
并列句	Then the sound changed to a quiet crunch of snow and creak of timber, and the dogs began to step out eagerly, and the motion became swift and smooth.
疑问句	Lyra, wrapped up so thickly in the back of Farder Coram's sledge that only her eyes were exposed, whispered to Pantalaimon: Can you see lorek?
陈述句	He's padding along beside Lee Scoresby's sledge, the daemon replied, looking back in his ermine form as he clung to her wolverine-fur hood.
并列句	Ahead of them, over the mountains to the north, the pale arcs and loops of the Northern Lights began to glow and tremble.
并列句	Lyra saw through half-closed eyes, and felt a sleepy thrill of perfect happiness, to be speeding north under the Aurora.
并列句	Pantalaimon struggled against her sleepiness, but it was too strong; he curled up as a mouse inside her hood.
并列句	He could tell her when they woke, and it was probably a marten, or a dream, or some kind of harmless local spirit; but something was following the train of sledges, swinging lightly from branch to branch of the close-clustering pine trees, and it put him uneasily in mind of a monkey.
并列句	TWELVE   THE LOST BOY     They traveled for several hours and then stopped to eat.
并列句	While the men were lighting fires and melting snow for water, with lorek Byrnison watching Lee Scoresby roast seal meat close by, John Faa spoke to Lyra.
疑问句	Lyra, can you see that instrument to read it?
陈述句	he said.
陈述句	The moon itself had long set.
并列句	The light from the Aurora was brighter than moonlight, but it was inconstant.
并列句	However, Lyra's eyes were keen, and she fumbled inside her furs and tugged out the black velvet bag.
陈述句	Yes, I can see all right, she said.
并列句	But I know where most of the symbols are by now anyway.
疑问句	What shall I ask it, Lord Faa?
陈述句	I want to know more about how they're defending this place, Bolvangar, he said.
并列句	Without even having to think about it, she found her fingers moving the hands to point to the helmet, the griffin, and the crucible, and felt her mind settle into the right meanings like a complicated diagram in three dimensions.
并列句	At once the needle began to swing round, back, round and on further, like a bee dancing its message to the hive.
并列句	She watched it calmly, content not to know at first but to know that a meaning was coming, and then it began to clear.
陈述句	She let it dance on until it was certain.
陈述句	It's just like the witch's daemon said, Lord Faa.
并列句	There's a company of Tartars guarding the station, and they got wires all round it.
陈述句	They don't really expect to be attacked, that's what the symbol reader says.
并列句	But Lord Faa... What, child?
陈述句	It's a telling me something else.
陈述句	In the next valley there's a village by a lake where the folk are troubled by a ghost.
并列句	John Faa shook his head impatiently, and said, That don't matter now.
陈述句	There's bound to be spirits of all kinds among these forests.
陈述句	Tell me again about them Tartars.
疑问句	How many, for instance?
疑问句	What are they armed with?
并列句	Lyra dutifully asked, and reported the answer: There's sixty men with rifles, and they got a couple of larger guns, sort of cannons.
陈述句	They got fire throwers too.
并列句	And... Their daemons are all wolves, that's what it says.
陈述句	That caused a stir among the older gyptians, those who'd campaigned before.
陈述句	The Sibirsk regiments have wolf daemons, said one.
陈述句	John Faa said, I never met fiercer.
陈述句	We shall have to fight like tigers.
并列句	And consult the bear; he's a shrewd warrior, that one.
并列句	Lyra was impatient, and said, But Lord Faa, this ghost-I think it's the ghost of one of the kids!
条件状语从句	Well, even if it is, Lyra, I don't know what anyone could do about it.
并列句	Sixty Sibirsk riflemen, and fire throwers...Mr. Scoresby, step over here if you would, for a moment.
并列句	While the aeronaut came to the sledge, Lyra slipped away and spoke to the bear.
疑问句	lorek, have you traveled this way before?
陈述句	Once, he said in that deep flat voice.
疑问句	There's a village near, en't there?
陈述句	Over the ridge, he said, looking up through the sparse trees.
疑问句	Is it far?
并列句	For you or for me?
陈述句	For me, she said.
陈述句	Too far.
陈述句	Not at all far for me.
疑问句	How long would it take you to get there, then?
并列句	I could be there and back three times by next moonrise.
原因状语从句	Because, lorek, listen: I got this symbol reader that tells me things, you see, and it's told me that there's something important I got to do over in that village, and Lord Faa won't let me go there.
并列句	He just wants to get on quick, and 1 know that's important too.
并列句	But unless I go and find out what it is, we might not know what the Gobblers are really doing.
陈述句	The bear said nothing.
陈述句	He was sitting up like a human, his great paws folded in his lap, his dark eyes looking into hers down the length of his muzzle.
陈述句	He knew she wanted something.
并列句	Pantalaimon spoke: Can you take us there and catch up with the sledges later on?
陈述句	I could.
并列句	But I have given my word to Lord Faa to obey him, not anyone else.
条件状语从句	If I got his permission?
陈述句	said Lyra.
陈述句	Then yes.
并列句	She turned and ran back through the snow.
感叹句	Lord Faa!
并列句	If lorek Byrnison takes me over the ridge to the village, we can find out whatever it is, and then catch the sledges up further on.
陈述句	He knows the route, she urged.
并列句	And I wouldn't ask, except it's like what I did before, Farder Coram, you remember, with that chameleon?
并列句	I didn't understand it then, but it was true, and we found out soon after.
陈述句	I got the same feeling now.
陈述句	I can't understand properly what it's saying, only I know it's important.
并列句	And lorek Byrnison knows the way, he says he could get there and back three times by next moonrise, and I couldn't be safer than I'd be with him, could I?
并列句	But he won't go without he gets Lord Faa's permission.
陈述句	There was a silence.
陈述句	Farder Coram sighed.
并列句	John Faa was frowning, and his mouth inside the fur hood was set grimly.
并列句	But before he could speak, the aeronaut put in: Lord Faa, if lorek Byrnison takes the little girl, she'll be as safe as if she was here with us.
并列句	All bears are true, but I've known lorek for years, and nothing under the sky will make him break his word.
并列句	Give him the charge to take care of her and he'll do it, make no mistake.
陈述句	As for speed, he can lope for hours without tiring.
并列句	But why should not some men go?
陈述句	said John Faa.
原因状语从句	Well, they'd have to walk, Lyra pointed out, because you couldn't run a sledge over that ridge.
并列句	lorek Byrnison can go faster than any man over that sort of country, and I'm light enough so's he won't be slowed down.
并列句	And I promise, Lord Faa, I promise not to be any longer than I need, and not to give anything away about us, or to get in any danger.
疑问句	You're sure you need to do this?
疑问句	That symbol reader en't playing the fool with you?
并列句	It never does, Lord Faa, and I don't think it could.
陈述句	John Faa rubbed his chin.
条件状语从句	Well, if all comes out right, we'll have a piece more knowledge than we do now.
疑问句	lorek Byrnison, he called, are you willing to do as this child bids?
陈述句	I do your bidding, Lord Faa.
并列句	Tell me to take the child there, and I will.
陈述句	Very well.
并列句	You are to take her where she wishes to go and do as she bids.
疑问句	Lyra, I'm a commanding you now, you understand?
陈述句	Yes, Lord Faa.
并列句	You go and search for whatever it is, and when you've found it, you turn right round and come back.
陈述句	lorek Byrnison, we'll be a traveling on by that time, so you'll have to catch us up.
陈述句	The bear nodded his great head.
疑问句	Are there any soldiers in the village?
陈述句	he said to Lyra.
疑问句	Will I need my armor?
陈述句	We shall be swifter without it.
陈述句	No, she said.
陈述句	I'm certain of that, lorek.
并列句	Thank you, Lord Faa, and I promise I'll do just as you say.
并列句	Tony Costa gave her a strip of dried seal meat to chew, and with Pantalaimon as a mouse inside her hood, Lyra clambered onto the great bear's back, gripping his fur with her mittens and his narrow muscular back between her knees.
并列句	His fur was wondrously thick, and the sense of immense power she felt was overwhelming.
并列句	As if she weighed nothing at all, he turned and loped away in a long swinging run up toward the ridge and into the low trees.
并列句	It took some time before she was used to the movement, and then she felt a wild exhilaration.
感叹句	She was riding a bear!
并列句	And the Aurora was swaying above them in golden arcs and loops, and all around was the bitter arctic cold and the immense silence of the North.
陈述句	lorek Byrnison's paws made hardly any sound as they padded forward through the snow.
并列句	The trees were thin and stunted here, for they were on the edge of the tundra, but there were brambles and snagging bushes in the path.
条件状语从句	The bear ripped through them as if they were cobwebs.
并列句	They climbed the low ridge, among outcrops of black rock, and were soon out of sight of the party behind them.
并列句	Lyra wanted to talk to the bear, and if he had been human, she would already be on familiar terms with him; but he was so strange and wild and cold that she was shy, almost for the first time in her life.
并列句	So as he loped along, his great legs swinging tirelessly, she sat with the movement and said nothing.
陈述句	Perhaps he preferred that anyway, she thought; she must seem a little prattling cub, only just past babyhood, in the eyes of an armored bear.
并列句	She had seldom considered herself before, and found the experience interesting but uncomfortable, very like riding the bear, in fact.
并列句	lorek Byrnison was pacing swiftly, moving both legs on one side of his body at the same time, and rocking from side to side in a steady powerful rhythm.
陈述句	She found she couldn't just sit: she had to ride actively.
并列句	They had been traveling for an hour or more, and Lyra was stiff and sore but deeply happy, when lorek Byrnison slowed down and stopped.
陈述句	Look up, he said.
并列句	Lyra raised her eyes and had to wipe them with the inside of her wrist, for she was so cold that tears were blurring them.
陈述句	When she could see clearly, she gasped at the sight of the sky.
并列句	The Aurora had faded to a pallid trembling glimmer, but the stars were as bright as diamonds, and across the great dark diamond-scattered vault, hundreds upon hundreds of tiny black shapes were flying out of the east and south toward the north.
疑问句	Are they birds?
陈述句	she said.
陈述句	They are witches, said the bear.
感叹句	Witches!
疑问句	What are they doing?
陈述句	Flying to war, maybe.
陈述句	I have never seen so many at one time.
疑问句	Do you know any witches, lorek?
陈述句	I have served some.
并列句	And fought some, too.
陈述句	This is a sight to frighten Lord Faa.
条件状语从句	If they are flying to the aid of your enemies, you should all be afraid.
陈述句	Lord Faa wouldn't be frightened.
疑问句	You en't afraid, are you?
陈述句	Not yet.
陈述句	When I am, I shall master the fear.
原因状语从句	But we had better tell Lord Faa about the witches, because the men might not have seen them.
并列句	He moved on more slowly, and she kept watching the sky until her eyes splintered again with tears of cold, and she saw no end to the numberless witches flying north.
并列句	Finally lorek Byrnison stopped and said, There is the village.
陈述句	They were looking down a broken, rugged slope toward a cluster of wooden buildings beside a wide stretch of snow as flat as could be, which Lyra took to be the frozen lake.
陈述句	A wooden jetty showed her she was right.
陈述句	They were no more than five minutes from the place.
疑问句	What do you want to do?
陈述句	the bear asked.
并列句	Lyra slipped off his back, and found it hard to stand.
并列句	Her face was stiff with cold and her legs were shaky, but she clung to his fur and stamped until she felt stronger.
并列句	There's a child or a ghost or something down in that village, she said, or maybe near it, I don't know for certain.
并列句	I want to go and find him and bring him back to Lord Faa and the others if I can.
并列句	I thought he was a ghost, but the symbol reader might be telling me something I can't understand.
条件状语从句	If he is outside, said the bear, he had better have some shelter.
并列句	I don't think he's dead, said Lyra, but she was far from sure.
并列句	The alethiometer had indicated something uncanny and unnatural, which was alarming; but who was she?
陈述句	Lord Asriel's daughter.
并列句	And who was under her command?
陈述句	A mighty bear.
疑问句	How could she possibly show any fear?
并列句	Let's just go and look, she said.
并列句	She clambered on his back again, and he set off down the broken slope, walking steadily and not pacing any more.
并列句	The dogs of the village smelled or heard or sensed them coming, and began to howl frightfully; and the reindeer in their enclosure moved about nervously, their antlers clashing like dry sticks.
陈述句	In the still air every movement could be heard for a long way.
并列句	As they reached the first of the houses, Lyra looked to the right and left, peering hard into the dimness, for the Aurora was fading and the moon still far from rising.
并列句	Here and there a light flickered under a snow-thick roof, and Lyra thought she saw pale faces behind some of the windowpanes, and imagined their astonishment to see a child riding a great white bear.
陈述句	At the center of the little village there was an open space next to the jetty, where boats had been drawn up, mounds under the snow.
并列句	The noise of the dogs was deafening, and just as Lyra thought it must have wakened everyone, a door opened and a man came out holding a rifle.
陈述句	His wolverine daemon leaped onto the woodstack beside the door, scattering snow.
并列句	Lyra slipped down at once and stood between him and lorek Byrnison, conscious that she had told the bear there was no need for his armor.
陈述句	The man spoke in words she couldn't understand.
并列句	lorek Byrnison replied in the same language, and the man gave a little moan of fear.
陈述句	He thinks we are devils, lorek told Lyra.
疑问句	What shall I say?
并列句	Tell him we're not devils, but we've got friends who are.
并列句	And we're looking for...Just a child.
陈述句	A strange child.
陈述句	Tell him that.
并列句	As soon as the bear had said that, the man pointed to the right, indicating some place further off, and spoke quickly.
条件状语从句	lorek Byrnison said, He asks if we have come to take the child away.
陈述句	They are afraid of it.
并列句	They have tried to drive it away, but it keeps coming back.
并列句	Tell him we'll take it away with us, but they were very bad to treat it like that.
疑问句	Where is it?
陈述句	The man explained, gesticulating fearfully.
并列句	Lyra was afraid he'd fire his rifle by mistake, but as soon as he'd spoken he hastened inside his house and shut the door.
陈述句	Lyra could see faces at every window.
疑问句	Where is the child?
陈述句	she said.
并列句	In the fish house, the bear told her, and turned to pad down toward the jetty.
陈述句	Lyra followed.
陈述句	She was horribly nervous.
并列句	The bear was making for a narrow wooden shed, raising his head to sniff this way and that, and when he reached the door he stopped and said: In there.
陈述句	Lyra's heart was beating so fast she could hardly breathe.
并列句	She raised her hand to knock at the door and then, feeling that that was ridiculous, took a deep breath to call out, but realized that she didn't know what to say.
感叹句	Oh, it was so dark now!
陈述句	She should have brought a lantern....
并列句	There was no choice, and anyway, she didn't want the bear to see her being afraid.
陈述句	He had spoken of mastering his fear: that was what she'd have to do.
并列句	She lifted the strap of reindeer hide holding the latch in place, and tugged hard against the frost binding the door shut.
陈述句	It opened with a snap.
并列句	She had to kick aside the snow piled against the foot of the door before she could pull it open, and Pantalaimon was no help, running back and forth in his ermine shape, a white shadow over the white ground, uttering little frightened sounds.
感叹句	Pan, for God's sake!
陈述句	she said.
陈述句	Be a bat.
并列句	Go and look for me....
并列句	But he wouldn't, and he wouldn't speak either.
并列句	She had never seen him like this except once, when she and Roger in the crypt at Jordan had moved the d^mon-coins into the wrong skulls.
陈述句	He was even more frightened than she was.
陈述句	As for lorek Byrnison, he was lying in the snow nearby, watching in silence.
陈述句	Come out, Lyra said as loud as she dared.
感叹句	Come out!
陈述句	Not a sound came in answer.
并列句	She pulled the door a little wider, and Pantalaimon leaped up into her arms, pushing and pushing at her in his cat form, and said, Go away!
感叹句	Don't stay here!
感叹句	Oh, Lyra, go now!
感叹句	Turn back!
并列句	Trying to hold him still, she was aware of lorek Byrnison getting to his feet, and turned to see a figure hastening down the track from the village, carrying a lantern.
并列句	When he came close enough to speak, he raised the lantern and held it to show his face: an old man with a broad, lined face, and eyes nearly lost in a thousand wrinkles.
陈述句	His daemon was an arctic fox.
并列句	He spoke, and lorek Byrnison said: He says that it's not the only child of that kind.
陈述句	He's seen others in the forest.
陈述句	Sometimes they die quickly, sometimes they don't die.
陈述句	This one is tough, he thinks.
并列句	But it would be better for him if he died.
条件状语从句	Ask him if I can borrow his lantern, Lyra said.
并列句	The bear spoke, and the man handed it to her at once, nodding vigorously.
并列句	She realized that he'd come down in order to bring it to her, and thanked him, and he nodded again and stood back, away from her and the hut and away from the bear.
条件状语从句	Lyra thought suddenly: what if the child is Roger?
并列句	And she prayed with all her force that it wouldn't be.
陈述句	Pantalaimon was clinging to her, an ermine again, his little claws hooked deep into her anorak.
并列句	She lifted the lantern high and took a step into the shed, and then she saw what it was that the Oblation Board was doing, and what was the nature of the sacrifice the children were having to make.
陈述句	The little boy was huddled against the wood drying rack where hung row upon row of gutted fish, all as stiff as boards.
原因状语从句	He was clutching a piece of fish to him as Lyra was clutching Pantalaimon, with her left hand, hard, against her heart; but that was all he had, a piece of dried fish; because he had no da;mon at all.
陈述句	The Gobblers had cut it away.
并列句	That was intercision, and this was a severed child.
并列句	THIRTEEN   FENCING     Her first impulse was to turn and run, or to be sick.
并列句	A human being with no daemon was like someone without a face, or with their ribs laid open and their heart torn out: something unnatural and uncanny that belonged to the world of night-ghasts, not the waking world of sense.
并列句	So Lyra clung to Pantalaimon and her head swam and her gorge rose, and cold as the night was, a sickly sweat moistened her flesh with something colder still.
陈述句	Ratter, said the boy.
疑问句	You got my Ratter?
陈述句	Lyra was in no doubt what he meant.
并列句	No, she said in a voice as frail and frightened as she felt.
疑问句	Then, What's your name?
陈述句	Tony Makarios, he said.
疑问句	Where's Ratter?
并列句	I don't know... she began, and swallowed hard to govern her nausea.
陈述句	The Gobblers...
并列句	But she couldn't finish.
原因状语从句	She had to go out of the shed and sit down by herself in the snow, except that of course she wasn't by herself, she was never by herself, because Pantalaimon was always there.
感叹句	Oh, to be cut from him as this little boy had been parted from his Ratter!
感叹句	The worst thing in the world!
并列句	She found herself sobbing, and Pantalaimon was whimpering too, and in both of them there was a passionate pity and sorrow for the half-boy.
陈述句	Then she got to her feet again.
陈述句	Come on, she called in a trembling voice.
陈述句	Tony, come out.
陈述句	We're going to take you somewhere safe.
并列句	There was a stir of movement in the fish house, and he appeared at the door, still clutching his dried fish.
并列句	He was dressed in warm enough garments, a thickly padded and quilted coal-silk anorak and fur boots, but they had a secondhand look and didn't fit well.
并列句	In the wider light outside that came from the faint trails of the Aurora and the snow-covered ground he looked more lost and piteous even than he had at first, crouching in the lantern light by the fish racks.
并列句	The villager who'd brought the lantern had retreated a few yards, and called down to them.
陈述句	lorek Byrnison interpreted: He says you must pay for that fish.
并列句	Lyra felt like telling the bear to kill him, but she said, We're taking the child away for them.
陈述句	They can afford to give one fish to pay for that.
陈述句	The bear spoke.
并列句	The man muttered, but didn't argue.
并列句	Lyra set his lantern down in the snow and took the half-boy's hand to guide him to the bear.
并列句	He came helplessly, showing no surprise and no fear at the great white beast standing so close, and when Lyra helped him to sit on lorek's back, all he said was: I dunno where my Ratter is.
陈述句	No, nor do we, Tony, she said.
并列句	But we'll...we'll punish the Gobblers.
陈述句	We'll do that, I promise.
条件状语从句	lorek, is it all right if I sit up there too?
陈述句	My armor weighs far more than children, he said.
并列句	So she scrambled up behind Tony and made him cling to the long stiff fur, and Pantalaimon sat inside her hood, warm and close and full of pity.
并列句	Lyra knew that Pantalaimon's impulse was to reach out and cuddle the little half-child, to lick him and gentle him and warm him as his own daemon would have done; but the great taboo prevented that, of course.
并列句	They rose through the village and up toward the ridge, and the villagers' faces were open with horror and a kind of fearful relief at seeing that hideously mutilated creature taken away by a girl and a great white bear.
并列句	In Lyra's heart, revulsion struggled with compassion, and compassion won.
陈述句	She put her arms around the skinny little form to hold him safe.
并列句	The journey back to the main party was colder, and harder, and darker, but it seemed to pass more quickly for all that.
并列句	lorek Byrnison was tireless, and Lyra's riding became automatic, so that she was never in danger of falling off.
并列句	The cold body in her arms was so light that in one way he was easy to manage, but he was inert; he sat stiffly without moving as the bear moved, so in another way he was difficult too.
陈述句	From time to time the half-boy spoke.
疑问句	What's that you said?
陈述句	asked Lyra.
疑问句	I says is she gonna know where I am?
并列句	Yeah, she'll know, she'll find you and we'll find her.
陈述句	Hold on tight now, Tony.
陈述句	It en't far from here....
陈述句	The bear loped onward.
陈述句	Lyra had no idea how tired she was until they caught up with the gyptians.
并列句	The sledges had stopped to rest the dogs, and suddenly there they all were, Farder Coram, Lord Faa, Lee Scoresby, all lunging forward to help and then falling back silent as they saw the other figure with Lyra.
并列句	She was so stiff that she couldn't even loosen her arms around his body, and John Faa himself had to pull them gently open and lift her off.
疑问句	Gracious God, what is this?
陈述句	he said.
疑问句	Lyra, child, what have you found?
陈述句	He's called Tony, she mumbled through frozen lips.
并列句	And they cut his daemon away.
陈述句	That's what the Gobblers do.
并列句	The men held back, fearful; but the bear spoke, to Lyra's weary amazement, chiding them.
感叹句	Shame on you!
感叹句	Think what this child has done!
并列句	You might not have more courage, but you should be ashamed to show less.
并列句	You're right, lorek Byrnison, said John Faa, and turned to give orders.
并列句	Build that fire up and heat some soup for the child.
陈述句	For both children.
疑问句	Farder Coram, is your shelter rigged?
陈述句	It is, John.
并列句	Bring her over and we'll get her warm.... And the little boy, said someone else.
并列句	He can eat and get warm, even if... Lyra was trying to tell John Faa about the witches, but they were all so busy, and she was so tired.
并列句	After a confusing few minutes full of lantern light, woodsmoke, figures hurrying to and fro, she felt a gentle nip on her ear from Pantalaimon's ermine teeth, and woke to find the bear's face a few inches from hers.
陈述句	The witches, Pantalaimon whispered.
陈述句	I called lorek.
陈述句	Oh yeah, she mumbled.
并列句	lorek, thank you for taking me there and back.
陈述句	I might not remember to tell Lord Faa about the witches, so you better do that instead of me.
并列句	She heard the bear agree, and then she fell asleep properly.
陈述句	When she woke up, it was as close to daylight as it was ever going to get.
并列句	The sky was pale in the southeast, and the air was suffused with a gray mist, through which the gyptians moved like bulky ghosts, loading sledges and harnessing dogs to the traces.
陈述句	She saw it all from the shelter on Farder Coram's sledge, inside which she lay under a heap of furs.
陈述句	Pantalaimon was fully awake before she was, trying the shape of an arctic fox before reverting to his favorite ermine.
并列句	lorek Byrnison was asleep in the snow nearby, his head on his great paws; but Farder Coram was up and busy, and as soon as he saw Pantalaimon emerge, he limped across to wake Lyra properly.
并列句	She saw him coming, and sat up to speak.
感叹句	Farder Coram, I know what it was that I couldn't understand!
原因状语从句	The alethiometer kept saying bird and not, and that didn't make sense, because it meant no daemon and I didn't see how it could be....What is it?
并列句	Lyra, I'm afraid to tell you this after what you done, but that little boy died an hour ago.
并列句	He couldn't settle, he couldn't stay in one place; he kept asking after his daemon, where she was, was she a coming soon, and all; and he kept such a tight hold on that bare old piece of fish as if...Oh, I can't speak of it, child; but he closed his eyes finally and fell still, and that was the first time he looked peaceful, for he was like any other dead person then, with their daemon gone in the course of nature.
并列句	They've been a trying to dig a grave for him, but the earth's bound like iron.
并列句	So John Faa ordered a fire built, and they're a going to cremate him, so as not to have him despoiled by carrion eaters.
并列句	Child, you did a brave thing and a good thing, and I'm proud of you.
陈述句	Now we know what terrible wickedness those people are capable of, we can see our duty plainer than ever.
原因状语从句	What you must do is rest and eat, because you fell asleep too soon to restore yourself last night, and you have to eat in these temperatures to stop yourself getting weak....
陈述句	He was fussing around, tucking the furs into place, tightening the tension rope across the body of the sledge, running the traces through his hands to untangle them.
疑问句	Farder Coram, where is the little boy now?
疑问句	Have they burned him yet?
陈述句	No, Lyra, he's a lying back there.
并列句	I want to go and see him.
并列句	He couldn't refuse her that, for she'd seen worse than a dead body, and it might calm her.
陈述句	So with Pantalaimon as a white hare bounding delicately at her side, she trudged along the line of sledges to where some men were piling brushwood.
陈述句	The boy's body lay under a checkered blanket beside the path.
并列句	She knelt and lifted the blanket in her mittened hands.
并列句	One man was about to stop her, but the others shook their heads.
陈述句	Pantalaimon crept close as Lyra looked down on the poor wasted face.
并列句	She slipped her hand out of the mitten and touched his eyes.
并列句	They were marble-cold, and Farder Coram had been right; poor little Tony Makarios was no different from any other human whose daemon had departed in death.
条件状语从句	Oh, if they took Pantalaimon from her!
并列句	She swept him up and hugged him as if she meant to press him right into her heart.
并列句	And all little Tony had was his pitiful piece offish.... Where was it?
陈述句	She pulled the blanket down.
陈述句	It was gone.
并列句	She was on her feet in a moment, and her eyes flashed fury at the men nearby.
疑问句	Where's his fish?
并列句	They stopped, puzzled, unsure what she meant; though some of their daemons knew, and looked at one another.
陈述句	One of the men began to grin uncertainly.
感叹句	Don't you dare laugh!
条件状语从句	I'll tear your lungs out if you laugh at him!
并列句	That's all he had to cling onto, just an old dried fish, that's all he had for a daemon to love and be kind to!
疑问句	Who's took it from him?
疑问句	Where's it gone?
并列句	Pantalaimon was a snarling snow leopard, just like Lord Asriel's daemon, but she didn't see that; all she saw was right and wrong.
陈述句	Easy, Lyra, said one man.
陈述句	Easy, child.
疑问句	Who's took it?
并列句	she flared again, and the gyptian took a step back from her passionate fury.
陈述句	I didn't know, said another man apologetically.
陈述句	I thought it was just what he'd been eating.
原因状语从句	I took it out his hand because I thought it was more respectful.
陈述句	That's all, Lyra.
疑问句	Then where is it?
陈述句	The man said uneasily, Not thinking he had a need for it, I gave it to my dogs.
陈述句	I do beg your pardon.
并列句	It en't my pardon you need, it's his, she said, and turned at once to kneel again, and laid her hand on the dead child's icy cheek.
并列句	Then an idea came to her, and she fumbled inside her furs.
并列句	The cold air struck through as she opened her anorak, but in a few seconds she had what she wanted, and took a gold coin from her purse before wrapping herself close again.
并列句	I want to borrow your knife, she said to the man who'd taken the fish, and when he'd let her have it, she said to Pantalaimon: What was her name?
并列句	He understood, of course, and said, Ratter.
并列句	She held the coin tight in her left mittened hand and, holding the knife like a pencil, scratched the lost daemon's name deeply into the gold.
并列句	I hope that'll do, if I provide for you like a Jordan Scholar, she whispered to the dead boy, and forced his teeth apart to slip the coin into his mouth.
并列句	It was hard, but she managed it, and managed to close his jaw again.
并列句	Then she gave the man back his knife and turned in the morning twilight to go back to Farder Coram.
并列句	He gave her a mug of soup straight off the fire, and she sipped it greedily.
疑问句	What we going to do about them witches, Farder Coram?
陈述句	she said.
条件状语从句	I wonder if your witch was one of them.
疑问句	My witch?
陈述句	I wouldn't presume that far, Lyra.
陈述句	They might be going anywhere.
并列句	There's all kinds of concerns that play on the life of witches, things invisible to us: mysterious sicknesses they fall prey to, which we'd shrug off; causes of war quite beyond our understanding; joys and sorrows bound up with the flowering of tiny plants up on the tundra....But I wish I'd seen them a flying, Lyra.
陈述句	I wish I'd been able to see a sight like that.
陈述句	Now drink up all that soup.
疑问句	D'you want some more?
陈述句	There's some pan-bread a cooking too.
原因状语从句	Eat up, child, because we're on our way soon.
并列句	The food revived Lyra, and presently the chill at her soul began to melt.
并列句	With the others, she went to watch the little half-child laid on his funeral pyre, and bowed her head and closed her eyes for John Faa's prayers; and then the men sprinkled coal spirit and set matches to it, and it was blazing in a moment.
陈述句	Once they were sure he was safely burned, they set off to travel again.
陈述句	It was a ghostly journey.
并列句	Snow began to fall early on, and soon the world was reduced to the gray shadows of the dogs ahead, the lurching and creaking of the sledge, the biting cold, and a swirling sea of big flakes only just darker than the sky and only just lighter than the ground.
陈述句	Through it all the dogs continued to run, tails high, breath puffing steam.
并列句	North and further north they ran, while the pallid noontide came and went and the twilight wrapped itself again around the world.
并列句	They stopped to eat and drink and rest in a fold of the hills, and to get their bearings, and while John Faa talked to Lee Scoresby about the way they might best use the balloon, Lyra thought of the spy-fly; and she asked Farder Coram what had happened to the smokeleaf tin he'd trapped it in.
陈述句	I've got it tucked away tight, he said.
并列句	It's down in the bottom of that kit bag, but there's nothing to see; I soldered it shut on board ship, like I said I would.
陈述句	I don't know what we're a going to do with it, to tell you the truth; maybe we could drop it down a fire mine, maybe that would settle it.
并列句	But you needn't worry, Lyra.
陈述句	While I've got it, you're safe.
并列句	The first chance she had, she plunged her arm down into the stiffly frosted canvas of the kit bag and brought up the little tin.
陈述句	She could feel the buzz it was making before she touched it.
并列句	While Farder Coram was talking to the other leaders, she took the tin to lorek Byrnison and explained her idea.
陈述句	It had come to her when she remembered his slicing so easily through the metal of the engine cover.
并列句	He listened, and then took the lid of a biscuit tin and deftly folded it into a small flat cylinder.
并列句	She marveled at the skill of his hands: unlike most bears, he and his kin had opposable thumb claws with which they could hold things still to work on them; and he had some innate sense of the strength and flexibility of metals which meant that he only had to lift it once or twice, flex it this way and that, and he could run a claw over it in a circle to score it for folding.
并列句	He did this now, folding the sides in and in until they stood in a raised rim and then making a lid to fit it.
并列句	At Lyra's bidding he made two: one the same size as the original smokeleaf tin, and another just big enough to contain the tin itself and a quantity of hairs and bits of moss and lichen all packed down tight to smother the noise.
并列句	When it was closed, it was the same size and shape as the alethiometer.
陈述句	When that was done, she sat next to lorek Byrnison as he gnawed a haunch of reindeer that was frozen as hard as wood.
疑问句	lorek, she said, is it hard not having a daemon?
疑问句	Don't you get lonely?
疑问句	Lonely?
陈述句	he said.
陈述句	I don't know.
陈述句	They tell me this is cold.
原因状语从句	I don't know what cold is, because I don't freeze.
陈述句	So I don't know what lonely means either.
陈述句	Bears are made to be solitary.
疑问句	What about the Svalbard bears?
陈述句	she said.
疑问句	There's thousands of them, en't there?
陈述句	That's what I heard.
并列句	He said nothing, but ripped the joint in half with a sound like a splitting log.
陈述句	Beg pardon, lorek, she said.
陈述句	I hope I en't offended you.
陈述句	It's just that I'm curious.
原因状语从句	See, I'm extra curious about the Svalbard bears because of my father.
疑问句	Who is your father?
陈述句	Lord Asriel.
并列句	And they got him captive on Svalbard, you see.
并列句	I think the Gobblers betrayed him and paid the bears to keep him in prison.
陈述句	I don't know.
陈述句	I am not a Svalbard bear.
陈述句	I thought you was.... No.
并列句	I was a Svalbard bear, but I am not now.
原因状语从句	I was sent away as a punishment because I killed another bear.
并列句	So I was deprived of my rank and my wealth and my armor and sent out to live at the edge of the human world and fight when I could find employment at it, or work at brutal tasks and drown my memory in raw spirits.
疑问句	Why did you kill the other bear?
陈述句	Anger.
并列句	There are ways among bears of turning away our anger with each other, but I was out of my own control.
并列句	So I killed him and I was justly punished.
并列句	And you were wealthy and high-ranking, said Lyra, marveling.
感叹句	Just like my father, lorek!
陈述句	That's just the same with him after I was born.
并列句	He killed someone too and they took all his wealth away.
让步状语从句	That was long before he got made a prisoner on Svalbard, though.
疑问句	I don't know anything about Svalbard, except it's in the farthest North....Is it all covered in ice?
疑问句	Can you get there over the frozen sea?
陈述句	Not from this coast.
陈述句	The sea is sometimes frozen south of it, sometimes not.
陈述句	You would need a boat.
并列句	Or a balloon, maybe.
并列句	Or a balloon, yes, but then you would need the right wind.
并列句	He gnawed the reindeer haunch, and a wild notion flew into Lyra's mind as she remembered all those witches in the night sky; but she said nothing about that.
并列句	Instead she asked lorek Byrnison about Svalbard, and listened eagerly as he told her of the slow-crawling glaciers, of the rocks and ice floes where the bright-tusked walruses lay in groups of a hundred or more, of the seas teeming with seals, of narwhals clashing their long white tusks above the icy water, of the great grim iron-bound coast, the cliffs a thousand feet and more high where the foul cliff-ghasts perched and swooped, the coal pits and the fire mines where the bearsmiths hammered out mighty sheets of iron and riveted them into armor...
条件状语从句	If they took your armor away, lorek, where did you get this set from?
陈述句	I made it myself in Nova Zembla from sky metal.
陈述句	Until I did that, I was incomplete.
陈述句	So bears can make their own souls... she said.
陈述句	There was a great deal in the world to know.
疑问句	Who is the king of Svalbard?
陈述句	she went on.
疑问句	Do bears have a king?
陈述句	He is called lofur Raknison.
陈述句	That name shook a little bell in Lyra's mind.
并列句	She'd heard it before, but where?
并列句	And not in a bear's voice, either, nor in a gyptian's.
并列句	The voice that had spoken it was a Scholar's, precise and pedantic and lazily arrogant, very much a Jordan College voice.
陈述句	She tried it again in her mind.
感叹句	Oh, she knew it so well!
并列句	And then she had it: the Retiring Room.
陈述句	The Scholars listening to Lord Asriel.
陈述句	It was the Palmerian Professor who had said something about lofur Raknison.
并列句	He'd used the word panserbj0rne, which Lyra didn't know, and she hadn't known that lofur Raknison was a bear; but what was it he'd said?
并列句	The king of Svalbard was vain, and he could be flattered.
并列句	There was something else, if only she could remember it, but so much had happened since then....
条件状语从句	If your father is a prisoner of the Svalbard bears, said lorek Byrnison, he will not escape.
陈述句	There is no wood there to make a boat.
条件状语从句	On the other hand, if he is a nobleman, he will be treated fairly.
并列句	They will give him a house to live in and a servant to wait on him, and food and fuel.
疑问句	Could the bears ever be defeated, lorek?
陈述句	No.
并列句	Or tricked, maybe?
并列句	He stopped gnawing and looked at her directly.
陈述句	Then he said, You will never defeat the armored bears.
陈述句	You have seen my armor; now look at my weapons.
并列句	He dropped the meat and held out his paws, palm upward, for her to look at.
并列句	Each black pad was covered in horny skin an inch or more thick, and each of the claws was as long as Lyra's hand at least, and as sharp as a knife.
陈述句	He let her run her hands over them wonderingly.
陈述句	One blow will crush a seal's skull, he said.
并列句	Or break a man's back, or tear off a limb.
并列句	And I can bite.
条件状语从句	If you had not stopped me in Trollesund, I would have crushed that man's head like an egg.
陈述句	So much for strength; now for trickery.
陈述句	You cannot trick a bear.
疑问句	You want to see proof?
并列句	Take a stick and fence with me.
并列句	Eager to try, she snapped a stick off a snow-laden bush, trimmed all the side shoots off, and swished it from side to side like a rapier.
并列句	lorek Byrnison sat back on his haunches and waited, forepaws in his lap.
原因状语从句	When she was ready, she faced him, but she didn't like to stab at him because he looked so peaceable.
并列句	So she flourished it, feinting to right and left, not intending to hit him at all, and he didn't move.
并列句	She did that several times, and not once did he move so much as an inch.
并列句	Finally she decided to thrust at him directly, not hard, but just to touch the stick to his stomach.
并列句	Instantly his paw reached forward and flicked the stick aside.
陈述句	Surprised, she tried again, with the same result.
并列句	He moved far more quickly and surely than she did.
并列句	She tried to hit him in earnest, wielding the stick like a fencer's foil, and not once did it land on his body.
并列句	He seemed to know what she intended before she did, and when she lunged at his head, the great paw swept the stick aside harmlessly, and when she feinted, he didn't move at all.
并列句	She became exasperated, and threw herself into a furious attack, jabbing and lashing and thrusting and stabbing, and never once did she get past those paws.
陈述句	They moved everywhere, precisely in time to parry, precisely at the right spot to block.
并列句	Finally she was frightened, and stopped.
并列句	She was sweating inside her furs, out of breath, exhausted, and the bear still sat impassive.
条件状语从句	If she had had a real sword with a murderous point, he would have been quite unharmed.
并列句	I bet you could catch bullets, she said, and threw the stick away.
疑问句	How do you do that?
陈述句	By not being human, he said.
陈述句	That's why you could never trick a bear.
并列句	We see tricks and deceit as plain as arms and legs.
陈述句	We can see in a way humans have forgotten.
并列句	But you know about this; you can understand the symbol reader.
疑问句	That en't the same, is it?
陈述句	she said.
陈述句	She was more nervous of the bear now than when she had seen his anger.
陈述句	It is the same, he said.
陈述句	Adults can't read it, as I understand.
陈述句	As I am to human fighters, so you are to adults with the symbol reader.
并列句	Yes, I suppose, she said, puzzled and unwilling.
疑问句	Does that mean I'll forget how to do it when I grow up?
疑问句	Who knows?
陈述句	I have never seen a symbol reader, nor anyone who could read them.
陈述句	Perhaps you are different from others.
并列句	He dropped to all fours again and went on gnawing his meat.
并列句	Lyra had unfastened her furs, but now the cold was striking in again and she had to do them up.
陈述句	All in all, it was a disquieting episode.
原因状语从句	She wanted to consult the alethiome-ter there and then, but it was too cold, and besides, they were calling for her because it was time to move on.
并列句	She took the tin boxes that lorek Byrnison had made, put the empty one back into Farder Coram's kit bag, and put the one with the spy-fly in it together with the alethiometer in the pouch at her waist.
陈述句	She was glad when they were moving again.
并列句	The leaders had agreed with Lee Scoresby that when they reached the next stopping place, they would inflate his balloon and he would spy from the air.
并列句	Naturally Lyra was eager to fly with him, and naturally it was forbidden; but she rode with him on the way there and pestered him with questions.
疑问句	Mr. Scoresby, how would you fly to Svalbard?
并列句	You'd need a dirigible with a gas engine, something like a zeppelin, or else a good south wind.
并列句	But hell, I wouldn't dare.
疑问句	Have you ever seen it?
陈述句	The bleakest barest most inhospitable godforsaken dead end of nowhere.
条件状语从句	I was just wondering, if lorek Bymison wanted to go back...
陈述句	He'd be killed.
陈述句	lorek's in exile.
陈述句	As soon as he set foot there, they'd tear him to pieces.
疑问句	How do you inflate your balloon, Mr. Scoresby?
陈述句	Two ways.
陈述句	I can make hydrogen by pouring sulfuric acid onto iron filings.
并列句	You catch the gas it gives off and gradually fill the balloon like that.
陈述句	The other way is to find a ground-gas vent near a fire mine.
并列句	There's a lot of gas under the ground here, and rock oil besides.
并列句	I can make gas from rock oil, if I need to, and from coal as well; it's not hard to make gas.
并列句	But the quickest way is to use ground gas.
陈述句	A good vent will fill the balloon in an hour.
疑问句	How many people can you carry?
条件状语从句	Six, if I need to.
疑问句	Could you carry lorek Byrnison in his armor?
陈述句	I have done.
并列句	I rescued him one time from the Tartars, when he was cut off and they were starving him out-that was in the Tunguska campaign; I flew in and took him off.
并列句	Sounds easy, but hell, I had to calculate the weight of that old boy by guess-work.
并列句	And then I had to bank on finding ground gas under the ice fort he'd made.
并列句	But I could see what kind of ground it was from the air, and I reckoned we'd be safe in digging.
并列句	See, to go down I have to let gas out of the balloon, and I can't get airborne again without more.
并列句	Anyway, we made it, armor and all.
疑问句	Mr. Scoresby, you know the Tartars make holes in people's heads?
陈述句	Oh, sure.
陈述句	They've been doing that for thousands of years.
并列句	In the Tunguska campaign we captured five Tartars alive, and three of them had holes in their skulls.
陈述句	One of them had two.
疑问句	They do it to each other?
陈述句	That's right.
并列句	First they cut partway around a circle of skin on the scalp, so they can lift up a flap and expose the bone.
并列句	Then they cut a little circle of bone out of the skull, very carefully so they don't penetrate the brain, and then they sew the scalp back over.
感叹句	I thought they did it to their enemies!
陈述句	Hell, no.
陈述句	It's a great privilege.
陈述句	They do it so the gods can talk to them.
疑问句	Did you ever hear of an explorer called Stanislaus Grumman?
疑问句	Grumman?
陈述句	Sure.
陈述句	I met one of his team when I flew over the Yenisei River two years back.
陈述句	He was going to live among the Tartar tribes up that way.
陈述句	Matter of fact, I think he had that hole in the skull done.
并列句	It was part of an initiation ceremony, but the man who told me didn't know much about it.
条件状语从句	So...If he was like an honorary Tartar, they wouldn't have killed him?
疑问句	Killed him?
疑问句	Is he dead then?
陈述句	Yeah.
陈述句	I saw his head, Lyra said proudly.
陈述句	My father found it.
陈述句	I saw it when he showed it to the Scholars at Jordan College in Oxford.
并列句	They'd scalped it, and all.
疑问句	Who'd scalped it?
陈述句	Well, the Tartars, that's what the Scholars thought....But maybe it wasn't.
陈述句	It might not have been Grumman's head, said Lee Scoresby.
陈述句	Your father might have been misleading the Scholars.
陈述句	I suppose he might, said Lyra thoughtfully.
陈述句	He was asking them for money.
并列句	And when they saw the head, they gave him the money?
陈述句	Yeah.
陈述句	Good trick to play.
陈述句	People are shocked when they see a thing like that; they don't like to look too close.
陈述句	Especially Scholars, said Lyra.
陈述句	Well, you'd know better than I would.
并列句	But if that was Grumman's head, I'll bet it wasn't the Tartars who scalped him.
并列句	They scalp their enemies, not their own, and he was a Tartar by adoption.
陈述句	Lyra turned that over in her mind as they drove on.
并列句	There were wide currents full of meaning flowing fast around her; the Gobblers and their cruelty, their fear of Dust, the city in the Aurora, her father in Svalbard, her mother....And where was she?
陈述句	The alethiometer, the witches flying northward.
并列句	And poor little Tony Makarios; and the clockwork spy-fly; and lorek Byrnison's uncanny fencing... She fell asleep.
并列句	And every hour they drew closer to Bolvangar.
并列句	FOURTEEN  BOLVANGAR LIGHTS     The fact that the gyptians had heard or seen nothing of Mrs. Coulter worried Farder Coram and John Faa more than they let Lyra know; but they weren't to know that she was worried too.
并列句	Lyra feared Mrs. Coulter and thought about her often.
并列句	And whereas Lord Asriel was now father, Mrs. Coulter was never mother.
并列句	The reason for that was Mrs. Coulter's daemon, the golden monkey, who had filled Pantalaimon with a powerful loathing, and who, Lyra felt, had pried into her secrets, and particularly that of the alethiometer.
并列句	And they were bound to be chasing her; it was silly to think otherwise.
条件状语从句	The spy-fly proved that, if nothing else.
并列句	But when an enemy did strike, it wasn't Mrs. Coulter.
并列句	The gyptians had planned to stop and rest their dogs, repair a couple of sledges, and get all their weapons into shape for the assault on Bolvangar.
并列句	John Faa hoped that Lee Scoresby might find some ground gas to fill his smaller balloon (for he had two, apparently) and go up to spy out the land.
并列句	However, the aeronaut attended to the condition of the weather as closely as a sailor, and he said there was going to be a fog; and sure enough, as soon as they stopped, a thick mist descended.
让步状语从句	Lee Scoresby knew he'd see nothing from the sky, so he had to content himself with checking his equipment, though it was all in meticulous order.
陈述句	Then, with no warning at all, a volley of arrows flew out of the dark.
并列句	Three gyptian men went down at once, and died so silently that no one heard a thing.
原因状语从句	Only when they slumped clumsily across the dog traces or lay unexpectedly still did the nearest men notice what was happening, and then it was already too late, because more arrows were flying at them.
并列句	Some men looked up, puzzled by the fast irregular knocking sounds that came from up and down the line as arrows hurtled into wood or frozen canvas.
陈述句	The first to come to his wits was John Faa, who shouted orders from the center of the line.
并列句	Cold hands and stiff limbs moved to obey as yet more arrows flew down like rain, straight rods of rain tipped with death.
并列句	Lyra was in the open, and the arrows were passing over her head.
并列句	Pantalaimon heard before she did, and became a leopard and knocked her over, making her less of a target.
并列句	Brushing snow out of her eyes, she rolled over to try and see what was happening, for the semidarkness seemed to be overflowing with confusion and noise.
并列句	She heard a mighty roar, and the clang and scrape of lorek Byrnison's armor as he leaped fully clad over the sledges and into the fog, and that was followed by screams, snarling, crunching and tearing sounds, great smashing blows, cries of terror and roars of bearish fury as he laid them waste.
并列句	But who was them?
陈述句	Lyra had seen no enemy figures yet.
并列句	The gyptians were swarming to defend the sledges, but that (as even Lyra could see) made them better targets; and their rifles were not easy to fire in gloves and mittens; she had only heard four or five shots, as against the ceaseless knocking rain of arrows.
并列句	And more and more men fell every minute.
感叹句	Oh, John Faa!
陈述句	she thought in anguish.
并列句	You didn't foresee this, and I didn't help you!
并列句	But she had no more than a second to think that, for there was a mighty snarl from Pantalaimon, and something- another daemon-hurtled at him and knocked him down, crushing all the breath out of Lyra herself; and then hands were hauling at her, lifting her, stifling her cry with foul-smelling mittens, tossing her through the air into another's arms, and then pushing her flat down into the snow again, so that she was dizzy and breathless and hurt all at once.
并列句	Her arms were hauled behind till her shoulders cracked, and someone lashed her wrists together, and then a hood was crammed over her head to muffle her screams, for scream she did, and lustily: lorek!
感叹句	lorek Byrnison!
感叹句	Help me!
并列句	But could he hear?
并列句	She couldn't tell; she was hurled this way and that, crushed onto a hard surface which then began to lurch and bump like a sledge.
并列句	The sounds that reached her were wild and confused.
并列句	She might have heard lorek Byrnison's roar, but it was a long way off, and then she was jolting over rough ground, arms twisted, mouth stifled, sobbing with rage and fear.
并列句	And strange voices spoke around her.
陈述句	Pan...
陈述句	I'm here, shh, I'll help you breathe.
并列句	Keep still... His mouse paws tugged at the hood until her mouth was freer, and she gulped at the frozen air.
疑问句	Who are they?
陈述句	she whispered.
陈述句	They look like Tartars.
陈述句	I think they hit John Faa.
陈述句	No- I saw him fall.
并列句	But he should have been ready for this sort of attack.
陈述句	We know that.
并列句	But we should have helped him!
感叹句	We should have been watching the alethiometer!
陈述句	Hush.
陈述句	Pretend to be unconscious.
并列句	There was a whip cracking, and the howl of racing dogs.
并列句	From the way she was being jerked and bounced about, Lyra could tell how fast they were going, and though she strained to hear the sounds of battle, all she made out was a forlorn volley of shots, muffled by the distance, and then the creak and rush and soft paw thuds in the snow were all there was to hear.
陈述句	They'll take us to the Gobblers, she whispered.
陈述句	The word severed came to their mind.
并列句	Horrible fear filled Lyra's body, and Pantalaimon nestled close against her.
陈述句	I'll fight, he said.
陈述句	So will I. I'll kill them.
陈述句	So will lorek when he finds out.
陈述句	He'll crush them to death.
疑问句	How far are we from Bolvangar?
并列句	Pantalaimon didn't know, but he thought it was less than a day's ride.
并列句	After they had been driving along for such a time that Lyra's body was in torment from cramp, the pace slackened a little, and someone roughly pulled off the hood.
陈述句	She looked up at a broad Asiatic face, under a wolverine hood, lit by flickering lamplight.
陈述句	His black eyes showed a glint of satisfaction, especially when Pantalaimon slid out of Lyra's anorak to bare his white ermine teeth in a hiss.
并列句	The man's daemon, a big heavy wolverine, snarled back, but Pantalaimon didn't flinch.
并列句	The man hauled Lyra up to a sitting position and propped her against the side of the sledge.
原因状语从句	She kept falling sideways because her hands were still tied behind her, and so he tied her feet together instead and released her hands.
并列句	Through the snow that was falling and the thick fog she saw how powerful this man was, and the sledge driver too, how balanced in the sledge, how much at home in this land in a way the gyptians weren't.
并列句	The man spoke, but of course she understood nothing.
陈述句	He tried a different language with the same result.
陈述句	Then he tried English.
疑问句	You name?
并列句	Pantalaimon bristled warningly, and she knew what he meant at once.
感叹句	So these men didn't know who she was!
原因状语从句	They hadn't kidnapped her because of her connection with Mrs. Coulter; so perhaps they weren't in the pay of the Gobblers after all.
陈述句	Lizzie Brooks, she said.
陈述句	Lissie Broogs, he said after her.
陈述句	We take you nice place.
陈述句	Nice peoples.
疑问句	Who are you?
陈述句	Samoyed peoples.
陈述句	Hunters.
疑问句	Where are you taking me?
陈述句	Nice place.
陈述句	Nice peoples.
疑问句	You have panserbjorne?
陈述句	For protection.
感叹句	No good!
